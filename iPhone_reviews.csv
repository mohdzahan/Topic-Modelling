The best iPhone - perfect combination of features!
","
This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.

Coming from Androids planning to stay.

Been a few weeks since I got the phone, coming from a Galaxy S10, only reason I had to switch was giving my phone away to someone else in the family, and every other Androids gotten awfully boring decided to give iPhones a shot after a long time and I don't think I will be switching back any time soon. If you come from a similar android flagship there are a few things you need to get used to, in terms of the software its snappy not as fast as some androids but it feels smooth and has a flow to it.Display is where you might get disappointed with but don't worry its not as bad as they say, its bright its got ample clarity and if you pixel peep you will see a few pixels here and there but nothing that will disappoint you but its brighter for some reason iOS has a very clean color palette which gives it a nice vibrant interface, watching video is alright but you will sure miss the deep blacks if you come from OLED but the dolby vision certification sure makes up for it.Battery is downright impressive I can go through a whole day without putting it on charge and still finish with more than 40 percent juice left and I often get close to 9 hours average in screen on time as well I even left the phone unattended for 8 hours and it only drained one percent and still went through the whole day without a hiccup.Camera is one of the best at what it does though Pixels and Galaxies might take slightly better pictures but if you use Instagram or Snapchat a lot this phone will do wonders for you miles ahead of any other android in terms of social media performance.There is a certain heft to the phone the S10 feels like paper and walking or holding this phone feels like a chore if you also have one of those fat spigen cases on but you will get used to it. I will suggest you put a case on this bad boy as it does tend to get scuffed around the edges my friends iPhone had the same problem.I dont have an Apple Ecosystem per se, but i got Airplay on my TV so I can stream my Apple Music library to it and play it over the sound system you can also do spotify.For someone who is coming from Android since a long time this phone is the cake, absolutely delight to use small things do make a difference and also no auxiliary or usb c so carry around a spare lighting cable around with you and also charging by default is at 5 watts you could use a fast charger to get it upto 18, though I havent found the charging slow maybe because I dont use it while it does charge.The notch is there but most of the action happens below it so its fine and you will start to ignore it after an hour.PS: lot of negative reviews for the seller but what I got was a phone fresh from the factory in her wraps and only had one wifi calling glitch which was my fault apart from that the phones been absolutely stellar and Amazons been great delivering it in the pandemic too

iPhone 11 review

iPhone11 Review A person who uses every major application of a phone such as a camera, notes, gaming, binge-watching, and also wants his phone to run smoothly for at least 3-5 years may go for iPhone11. According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I  thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.  One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.  Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.  Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.  Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.  Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but,  my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.

After  5 years of loyalty towards OnePlus and 8years towards Android, Finally moved to an IPhone after all the intense brainstorming and research and the obvious Skepticism around different news floating around questioning its authenticity.For me, the seller was Darshita Electronics (All my 8phones to date has come from this seller and all of them were 100% genuine.About Iphone 11 128GB White, neatly packaged and delivered,To do's to check if the phone is Original,1. Shoot an uninterrupted video of the delivery you receive from the delivery guy and unboxing2. Ensure you capture the entire phone and accessories and point out any damage/defect (if observed)3. Check for the imei number from apple site and imei24 on status of any imei4. Boot the phone and wait for ""Apple logo to load"" setup the face lock - This is a key feature which nobody can copy5. Try locking the phone and unlocking the phone 4-5times using face unlock6. Screen bezels should be uniform from left, Right and bottom sides7. No additional softwares apart from Apple defaultsWhat did I like about this phone?1. Great body and design - Feels and fits perfect in hand (Damn balanced)2. Stellar Camera - Even a Novice would be able to capture great pictures and very easy yet powerful editing features3. Super fluid OS experience - Now I understood what ""Buttery experience meant all these years""4. Battery life is good, Screen-On-Time of ~7hours depending on the usage - I had my Wifi continuously switched on and Bluetoth for ~2hrs - I must say for 3100mah battery it very well optimized compared to 4000mah of other phones5. Wireless charging - (Which might be useful for some people but not me)6. A great deal from Security, Experience, Durability and Hardware Perspective7.  Still providing Charger and Earpods(Wired) - So better go for this compared to Apple online storeWhat is not present but doesn't make difference?1. 90Hz display could have made it amazing but can't expect that from a year-old model and doesnt make difference in india at least2. 5G is not present - So, good to go for 2-3years without updating any further than IOS153. InBox charger could have been 12W(2hr charging time) charger instead of 5W(3.5hr charging time) - OnePlus provide 40min charging4. Super Amoled could have improved the viewing experience but its still fineRecommendation: If can spend up to 55k then just go for it without any hesitation. Better than any 40-50k phone out there. Colors available are also great. I was looking for Mint but didn't get it. Try your luck though. Hope this helped.

If u read the review you will know that there are many bad comments. Am also intrigued by it while buying from Amazon, bought during great india sale with a great value for money. Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Don’t always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but it’s always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it ₹1500 to ₹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So that’s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12. Lastly, i have a great experience of using the phone so am happy that i snub xiaomi, oneplus and samsung in the price range. But it takes a lot of time jumping from android to ios, so it will always be a personal choice

A detailed review

After 3 months of usage, It feels smooth and it’s the first time I’ve used an IOS device. Following are few points describing the product.1) Screen and display:The screen is quite comfortable to look at and the adaptive display works excellent. The transition from one app to another is so smooth and satisfying. The display adapts according to lighting and quite easy on the eyes. There’s blue light filter (true tone) which gives a warm hue to the display. Brightness when set to max is excellent even in day light.Update: The phone is dust proof and waterproof and underwater pictures are phenomenal. No need to worry if you dropped your phone in water.2) Software:Currently on IOS 14, the interface is to a next level. It took few days to adapt according to the interface but now, every app is smooth and easy to use.The face unlock is so accurate as it uses infrared light and smart unlock. That means no one can unlock your phone while you’re asleep so your phone is secure. Also you can unlock your phone even in dim to dark lit rooms or in absolutely no external light. The phone has lot’s of shortcuts making your use super easy and quick. No doubt about the security! Each and every bit of data is safe on your device.3) batteryAs I’m not a heavy gamer, the battery is enough for an entire day or 2 at max. Switching from android to iOS i used battery of 6000mah which still is more than apple’s 3110mah but the ios battery management is really great. You can watch videos at max brightness for quite a long time on this plus if you’re a heavy gamer, you may have to charge the device maybe twice a day. Also the battery optimisation is an excellent feature which saves your device from overcharging.4) cameraWell it’s iphone baby! Camera is excellent and most clear pictures and videos are captured from the camera. A 10/10 for camera and videos. If you’re into making content for YouTube or instagram, this phone’s camera would be perfect. Also the pictures captured are quite vivid.Few cons of the device1) The notch takes up little more space of the screen. I personally don’t find it annoying but few people may.2) Phone may heat a little during charging.3) If you bought this after selling your kidney, you must stay hydrated. Be very careful with your phone as even a little scratch would hurt your heart a lot.

Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone’s features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a “Liquid Retina display”; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won’t notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ₹, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the “budget” phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79₹ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase “it just works” really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn’t too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It’s safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the “soli” chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It’s Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won’t say too much on this topic as it’s well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it’s hardware.

So far so good...(1 week user)

I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don’t worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn’t you just need to use your passcode so it isn’t bad. For the most part it’s quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer.

Detailed Review// Unexpected 😲
","
First of all a very big thank you to Amazon great Indian sale as I bought this device for 46,249 and I really did not expect that I would get iPhone 11 at this price I’m truly very happy that I could wait all this long to buy a new phone. Eventually I never thought that I would be an Apple fan as I was a big time android user for 10 years.Well I was about to buy one +8 pro and I was quite confused whether should I go with one +8 pro or iPhone 11. I compared both the phones and eventually I decided to go with iPhone 11 as one +8 pro camera is really not up to the mark for what we actually pay in fact if I want to compare Samsung M series phones have better camera than one +8 pro. Other than camera one +8 pro is really a top notch phone in terms of display and sound quality.No let’s talk about iPhone 11 and I am giving this review after 20 days of my usage & I am really a heavy user.Camera as outstanding, top notch, till now and from past 10 years I have never seen a camera which is this amazing in terms of quality and shots infact night mode is extremely superb. The ultrawide camera is the best ultrawide camera which iPhone 11 gives and comparing iPhone 11 with one +8 pro it’s a shame even though one +8 pro gives a 48 megapixel camera it doesn’t give the best quality & filed of view.Talking about performance trust me this has one of the powerful chipset if compared to snapdragon 865, Like really no other phone can beat it.I don’t know what sampling rate iPhone 11 has but the display is amazingly smooth and silky; that touch response is a “WOW”The face recognition is amazing!! more than my expectations because it really doesn’t work like what android system is, The privacy and security which iPhone offers is the best.Now talking about battery life it is really good when it comes to a standby mode but when you actually keep using the phone continuously, it drains out and maximum time you can use is just 5 hours 35 minutes. And charging time with 5W charger takes more than 2 hours 30 minutes.Talking about build quality it is good, stylish, superb but kind of heavy as it has the best glass on both sides infact on the first day itself it fell down from a height of 4 feet and I was surprised that it didn’t break.Talking about gaming, trust me it heats a lot. I mean I have played PUBG at high graphics as well as Asphalt 9 and the back panel does heat up quickly and at some point you cannot even hold it.So I would say, Buying an iPhone for gaming won’t be a good choice as it heats up a lot and playing continuously will definitely drain out the battery....I was quite worried to buy an iPhone from Amazon because there were lot of negative reviews and few of them said that it’s a fraud and they have been cheated but luckily in my case; 🤞🏼I really got the original product, a genuine one and I didn’t face any issue in terms of packaging.

This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

Best but Amazon ruined it ;(

Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn’t quite there at least not for me.It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn’t.To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won’t allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ₹3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!

First time apple user & as secondary phone to one and only Nokia - Read full review
","
Update after 2 Years of Usage : Ah it actually started showing its colours ...Now on iOS 16.3  Though I am a concious user who take care of all settings appropriately , Still i can see the UI stutters , Messaging App Crashes , and Device takes time to Lock the screen(Even with click speed set to Default)  , Even after reset the issue persists .. Becarefull of spending money on these issues ..First thing Face ID is impressive and stands out , Everything else is on the same lines as some of the Nokia Phones released on Windows and Android platforms. Nokia's Pure display is way ahead. Audio Quality is somewhat better in iPhone11 may be on par to some Music Express Phones of Nokia from past. iOS14 widgets (Widget Apps are very limited) are a straight copy of Live tiles on Lumia Phones of 2012 - 2016 .. Nokia was ahead of time. Data Security is good on iphone but don't forget that NYPD (New York Police department ) used Nokia Windows Phones for secure communication during its time. Even Nokia Android Phones are most secure compared to others on Android Platform except Pixel.Camera : Selfie Camera is average and my Nokia 9 takes superb selfie images although the SW in Nokia is too slow,Main Camera is an example of better coupling of Apple HW and SW which give some of the best images. Nokia 9 too takes a professional grade images but at the cost of slow SW and over exposure in some light conditions.Felt iphone 11 bit broader by 2 mm to master the usage in one hand , also not providing justice to its interface which has flexibility to use in one hand in certain use cases. But still menu navigation requires both hands.. Which is opposite to Android 10 Gesture Navigation.After two weeks usage i found bugs in Siri Assistant - Fails to get directions for some places on Apple Maps and also on Google maps --- Spending big money for this silly bug is super waste.Being typical Indian user reluctant to pay 20 Rupees for a ringtone , Wallpaper on App store - Lets me down.Whatsapp Chats cant backed up from Android device for free .. Have to spend atleast 1500 INR through 3rd party SW by risking your data which iam not interested.Overall not a good Value proposition ... Hope same with iphone 12 too. End am not cribbing too as i got this piece of gadget for 40k after cashback and selling my old device outside Amazon for better price.IMO - Go for either Pixel or Nokia or Samsung or Oneplus for peaceful experience except others like Vivo, Oppo , Mi , realme which are bloatware junks and shows their colors within in 6 months of usage.

Sorry for giving a late feedback.It has already been past three years since I am using this phone but till I don’t feel regret that why I bought this phone because this phone didn’t give me a chance to think in a negative way. The reason why I choose iPhone because of it’s security.Camera - It gives a real image how you look like just an ex - if you have dark spot or scar’s then it will be clearly visible after snapping a picture.Music - Without plugging any input, you can feel the sound of every effects like bass, treble, mono, pop etc. and it depends upon the song’s origin composition.Safari - It is one of the safest and handy browser that you will find whatever you want with SSL (Secure socket layer).Apart from this there are so many third party application which run smoothly.Last but not the least “iPhones is the love 😍”

10 months agoi've had android for 5 years i was looking for a change in pace when i switched over to boost. My first iphone was a 6s Plus with boost mobile, after having it for a week i became an iphone fan. i overall enjoyed the camera, processing power,and the polarizing display. What i did not like was the battery life, that aspect needed improvement. When the boost guy at store mentioned i could get a new phone through payments i looked into a new device because i did not enjoy the battery life lasting me 4 to 6 hours after being charged 100%. So after talking to apple experts and even samsung enthusiasts i came to the cross road of the s10e and iphone 11 (the regular) and decided to give a go on the iphone 11 after the store rep mentioned iphones pick up better compared to samsung in the area i live. SURE ENOUGH!!! spots with no signal..BOOM! SERVICE! now keep in mind im not saying you'll have service every where you go due to some areas having no service, but i can vouch that areas my iphone 6s plus struggled to load or pick up a siganl bar at drastically improved. ALONG WITH BATTERY LIFE!!! this phone lasts me 10 to 12 hours off a single charge. keep in mind no i do not use low power mode thats just how good the battery life is on the iphone 11. lastly, i know there's android devices on the market that boast a big screen, long lasting battery life, and good cameras which are cheaper compared to iphones but thats the problem i kept running into was finding a durable phone. after 5 years of using the android platform i went through 8 or 10 devices from zte, lg, and samsung. all because the storage was too full, or because an antennae or battery had burned out. from what i hear iphone 11 users should expect a life span of 3 years. thats pretty good considering i go through phones because of internal issues not physical damage like crazyyy!!! overall look the iphone 11 is engineered quality in the camera, storage, battery, processing and display department. the price is well worth THE QUALITY put into this phone

Honest review. Must read. Timely updates

Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..Update: phone is working good the way i use it my phone is still at 100% capacity.. daily avg use is 2:30hrs to 4:15hrsI have not installed any google apps at all. And no streaming appsOnly work and paytm and banking appsWith social media apps excluding facebookUpdate #2 it is almost a year now and my battery health is still at 100%. i charge at 30% and till 82-86%no fb snapchat or any google app. PEACE.Update #3 1year 6+months battery health at 97% because i was using mobile data in outside weather condition feels a bit heated at times but its because of the ios update but doing fine. PEACE.Update #4 2years 6 months, battery health at 89% and i have installed netflix, prime etc because as my brother suggested.. use it/dont use it.. the battery is bound to deteriorate.. still works well.. no lags or heating issue as such (other than a couple of apps that fire up the phone but then i stop using it over mobile data and its all fine). And since the battery is going down.. i charge it till 90% PEACE.

My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.

I REALLY NEED A HELP -:Firstly I would like to sum up the fact that I have saved so much of money just to buy this IPhone 11 and now I’m so much more disappointed by the fact that I got scammed? Like seriouslyThe main Problem :So I have gotten this phone and I was so happy for a fact that I got an iPhone and yea the phone was completely working fine and after 2 months since the purchase of the phone my ‘FACE ID ‘ has stopped working and I checked up google for what to do and many has faced the same and were like “it’s probably a bug and would be fixed after a software update “ , so I waited and even after 3 times updating my device the problem wasn’t resolvedWhat I did was contacted the Apple toll free number and told them my issue and they have raised a ticket and I gave my phone to the Apple authorised reseller and after a week long I receive an email stating “ device has been been found with “unauthorised modification “NOTE THAT I HAVEN’t GIVEN MY PHONE TO ANY SERVICE CENTRE OR ANYTHING AND THIS IS MY FIRST TIME GIVING MY PHONE TO THIS SPECIFIC AUTHORISED RESELLER AND THE APPLE CUSTOMER CARE HAS BOOKED THIS SERVICE CENTRE .I didn’t get my issue fixed and have asked the apple service centre and they have told they can’t do anything from their end and have told me to call the Amazon customer service.I immediately called the Amazon customer service and they have asked me the purchase receipt, my warranty and the phones IMEI number and have provided them everything they asked and they told me to wait for 5 -6 days and to call them after that , so I called after 5 days and they told me that THEY CLAIM THAT I GAVE MY PHONE SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE AND DID SOME MODIFICATIONS AND THAT THE WARRANTY WONT BE CLAIMED IF I DID SO , but like I genuinely am writing this with so much concern that I haven’t given my phone anywhere for any service or anything . They told me that they can’t do anything about it and I have no choice than to suffer with this defected phone without FACE ID .I don’t understand the fact that why can’t they do anything about it ?Was it my fault in buying an iPhone on Amazon ?What now ? Getting an IPhone for 48 thousand and not getting the full benefits of it ?What is the solution?I have learnt a lesson to not buy any phones from Amazon . Really very disappointed AMAZON.

""Made in India"" Apple  #iPhone11
","
I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 6S that is about ""5 generations"" behind and started checking out specks of iPhone 13. In the end, I decided on iPhone11 (64 GB) for a couple of reasons* I have been a fan of buy once and forget, and iPhones are just this kind of device* Going for an n-1 or n-2 model is not only prudent but also a financially smart move* Buying an iPhone 11 at 50-60% of the cost of a 13 will keep me going for 4-5 years. Money well spent.* iPhone 11 is ""Made in India"" and the price on Amazon (during Great India sale) after discounts was comparable to what I would have paid on Amazon.com in the US!A few buyers regrets* I bought a Black iPhone, and with a black case (even with a see-through), it doesn't stand out as an ""iPhone."" I can't flaunt the lobo without being obvious about it :-)* If you are looking to flaunt your iPhone for statue, go with a white or red model* iPhone 11 UI without the distinctive 'home button' feels very unlike iPhone User Experience those of us with older models were used to.* iOS 15 and UI are taking things closer to Android UI that Apple fans like me don't relishThis phone is 'Made in India,' so if you are a fan of buy-swadeshi, this would be a plus.Bottomline, if you are looking for a relatively 'inexpensive' iPhone that is going to last for next 4-5 years, go for an iPhone11. Money well spent.

An excellent response received from AMAZON, IF I am not sharing my experience, it will deemed to b an unfair on my part.During recent festive season, being a prime member, i hv purchased iphone 11on 16th 12.05 am. And also got it same at my residance with very speedily on 18th in safe n  superb packing.But after inserting sim card i hv noticed that incoming call ringer volume was not working,  i hv contacted APPLE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM, they tried to resolve the problem,  through screen sharing,  they hv tried,  there level the best,  but couldn't get successed and saying that this is product manufacturing defect and advised to contact apple service centre, with sending me a (service centre) link, which was 400km away from  my residence.i explained my inability to opt it, hence he advised to contact AMAZON from which it was purchased .Then i hv contacted AMAZONE, customer service centre, described all these, then via via via an authorised executive talked with me,  explaining all the details and requested to help me out. He said, we have made a tie up with company to sell these products from AMAZON platform, hence apple is only the authority to help u in this regards.  I explained i m a amazone customer since more then 5 years, during this 5 years period  i hv  purchased high value consumer durables with pre payment orders including in last festival season purchased smartphone one+ 7 pro, Uptill now I am fully satisfied with the cost, product and service of AMAZONE.(henceforth a trust image and credit of AMAZONE is very well established in my mind and belief)Otherwise I could purchased  iphone 11 from apple store,  it is now available,online apple store india, with more discount scheme.After prolonged discussion and my special request,he took the decision in my favor to replace it with providing me New iphone 11 without recovering any extra charges ( though i hv offered penalty to me if any)Uptill now amazone was good for me for online safe shopping but now taking proud of (prime member ) being a  cutomer of AMAZONE.If i had purchased iphone 11 from local market and if happened like this, would not  be possible for replacement.Salute to AMAZONE. I AM HIGHLY OBLIGED.Bharat Mansata.

Great phone , Very tough exchange process
","
PROS :1. Excellent phone with sleek screen2. Excellent battery lasting more than a day3. Face recognition is smoothCONS:1. Just the exchange process is very very complexIf you are exchanging an old phone strongly recommend not to do so. If you wish to do so here are the steps1. Please take complete back up in advance of the phone you like to exchange2. Erase all data except Amazon app. Even if you have the Amazon app on a different phone, please have Amazon app installed on the phone which you are going to give away3. Once the delivery agent comes to you, ask for a pin 6 digit number.4. You have to first enter the six digit number on the phone in the Amazon app on the order. Yes, this has to be keyed in on same order you had made and there is a provision space to enter on same.5. This step is quite complex but this is done for security to ensure you exchange the right phone.6. Once validated (Takes about 10 to 30 minutes depending on data / passwords you have stored) you then have to provide a 6 digit OTP which you would have received on your mobile and email.7. Then the agent verifies the 6 digit OTP on his device.8. If this gets done, PLEASE ENSURE YOU REMOVE YOUR SIM , DELETE THE AMAZON APP AND DATA FROM THE device you are going to give away.9. Final but most important - ensure the device is deleted from iCloud if you are exchanging iPhone . If non iPhone ensure you format the phone and ONLY THEN HAND IT OVER TO DELIVERY AGENT.10. In any possibility it would take 10 to 45 minutes to complete the exchange steps above depending on your data on phone plus the support of delivery or customer service.I had to wait for 24 hours to re do all steps and then went for it as I urgently needed this phone. Else best to exchange in a store nearby and just go for phone.SUMMARY:GREAT PHONE, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CALL CENTER FOLKS, GREAT EXCHANGE PRICE BUT EXTREMELY TOUGH EXCHANGE PROCESS.

A premium device for a moderate user.

I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying.I had iPhone 5s as my first phone.  It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster.  Will update the review after few months.Build quality is remarkable.IOS 14 is a magic.Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision.  Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.If you are a photo person, this one is for you.Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship,  be ready for repeated charge cycles.  😅This is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.Update after approx one and half month of usage : Battery performance is exceeding the expectations. 😍😍

Switching from Android to iOS ( And it’s actually Good )
","
I had my doubts before buying iOS product because I’ve been using Android for a very long time, I’ve stock android experience so I know what kind of difference does it make from android to iOS.- iOS is real smooth! If you go to the spec sheet of an Android even if you have 6GB or 8GB (not stock android) of RAM it’s gonna Hang at some point after accessing many apps.- The phone heats up less as compared to normal Androids.- The Sound quality of iPhones are immersive! Even if you’re not a big fan of listening to music or sounds on speaker you’ll still find a quality sound!-  About the camera, hats off to the sensors and AI. The picture quality in low light is too good and vibrant, the blacks do look like blacks (not a low contrast image), many of the colors bloom and it’s wonderful.The Video have soo much better stabilisation and even you can switch from one lens to another while shooting. The quality is again the best out there.Camera shutter is really fast and better. And clicks are responsive.Though zoom quality is not that good but why you wanna zoom if you have a composed image.- The Battery Life is quite nominal like it can work after a whole day usage. If your Screen time is around 5hrs 30mins it can go from 100 to 28-30%.PS : Battery Saver works really well, can extend upto minutes of Battery Life.- The Haptic touch is far better than the Androids. Feedback is really good.- The shape is quite good handful! Curved edges does gives 2019 vibes but yeah the phone works pretty well in 2021.- I agree that you gonna miss Android features but iPhone has it’s own resemblance. iOS have now comparable features as to android even some are better.At the end I’d Recommend this. Even if you’re switching from iPhone 6S or 7, this might be your another jumpad! And to Android users yeah this device is worth the Money.

Honest review after using for 1 month
","
I am writing this review exactly after using this product for 1 month. I was skeptical after reading so many negative reviews for this phone but still took a chance to buy. I received the product the very next day with perfect packaging and everything intact. Purchased this product for around 46k after receiving debit card discount. Unboxed it and there was this premium looking phone. I have received all the accessories and a brand new product.I was an android user for past 11 years so using this product was an entirely different experience.Pros:1. Superb processor-  My iphone has not hanged a single time while using regressively. 10+ apps are opened at once still it was buttery smooth2. Amazing camera- The night mode feature of the camera seal the deal with good potrait mode3. Battery lasting for a day- I have always heard from my friends that iPhone doesn't have a good battery back up but this model is lasting for a day which is sufficient4. No heating issue- I have not faced any heating issue till date5. Security- The phone has good features for securing the data and doesn't have unnecessary applicationsCons:1. Charger- The charger provided with this phone is just not sufficient. It takes 3 hours to charge my phone2. No 3.5mm jack- It doesn't have a designated port for connecting your normal headphones. You have to buy expensive jack of 900rs from apple stores3. Slo mo video- The slo mo videos created on the phone creates distorted image and feels like it has been taken by a 2 year old child who cannot hold the phone still.4. Customisation- An android user knows how easy it is to customize their phone according to their preference. You can customise a little on iphone but it is very limited.5. Expensive- iPhone which costs around 50k also needs accessories which are expensive like fast charger for around 1900rs, 3.5mm lightening jack 900rs, icloud storage 75rs/month, apple care etc.Overall I am really impressed with the product and these cons can somewhat be neglected if you're an iPhone user for a long time.

For android users... don’t switch.. for iPhone users it’s an upgrade

Honest review- I upgraded from one plus three and after much contemplation and money calculation I bought iphone11 for a discounted price.. now coming to the reviewCameraAwesome, few new features where you can change the background light is impeccable but having said that if you zoom the pix they appear a bit grainy.BatteryFor normal Facebook Watsapp news usage it will last you a day but the charger is not a fast charging one which is a big big let down...having spent so much you expect fast charging atleast.. had to buy a new fast charger you know one plus 3 kind of makes you nostalgic abt this particulr featureProcessor- is ok.. for a layman like me u wouldn’t feel the difference between An iPhone processor or a snapdragon 865+. So it’s fine haven’t played games so can’t complain or commentFor making the best use of this phone you should have AirPods since they give u iPhone specific connector type earphones which is fine but you just can’t pick any 3.55 mm jack earphone and use it. This phone makes you work hard.. like u want to use the watch app but you need to get one!!! 💁🏼‍♂️...TouchI think my one plus does well farely  better than iPhone 11It’s little hard to navigate maybe after sometime I get hang of itI would say with these features it should cost around30-40k.And I do t know why ppl praise it so much I think the guilt of having spent so much eggs them to say and write positive things only.All in all for all the android users you re not losing out on anything major, you are better off without an iPhone!I am still using my one plus 3

I was android used moved from pixel 2xl to iPhone 11 as per my budget.Its been more than 1 week I’m using this as a my daily driver smartphone.Whats i noticed here is:1. Overall its a good phone but screen display is not oled or amoled so it doesn’t feel premium display. Even my pixel2xl display is better than this.2. Battery backup is also average its same like my pixel 2xl phone.3. Performance and speed is so good.4. Software experience is very nice but ui customisation is limitation. My pixel win here.5. Great camera little bit better camera as compare to my pixel phone but pixel is 3-4 year old phone. Still great camera it has.6. I bought this phone because I wanna experience ios os features.7. Designs is ok but not so wow kind of in this 2020.8. Hardware quality is premium.9. Overpriced smartphone I personally think.10. I feeling looted because i have so much better options in android less than 60k price.11. Display does matter so i will suggest don’t buy this phone go for Oneplus or samsung.12. Faceid is useless sometimes in night or some place its not working properly everytime showing face at some angle is freaking process. Why they aren’t providing touchid side by side like android phone.13. I’m happy with this phone quality but not happy with this 60k price point.I personally feel this phone isn’t a 2020 generation phone guys.Because we have full screen and best display with 90hz refresh rate with less tha 60k price point so why u wanna buy this phone only for chipset and camera and nothing else.I will suggest don’t buy this phone its not 2020 generation phone.

Camera is super good even good than some of the flagship Android in 20212. Performance is undoubtedly the best no lag easy multi tasking heavy games like PUBG/ BGMI runs super smooth with constant 60 fps.3. Battery life : By looking at the spec sheet I was a bit worried coz it is way smaller than my android phone but to be surprised it is lasting way longer than I expected. I am a very heavy user so I need to charge my phone 2 times a day i.e from 90%-35% to maintain battery health4. Build quality : Super premium. Feels good in hand.5. Speakers : Loud enough for your mom to say ' avaj kam kr de kitna Shor krra h' 😂Cons:1. Display : Quality is not good for 2021 standards. It's not like that it's bad but not upto the mark compared to even some midrange android phones.2. Notch : Feels a bit weird in 2021. This is subjective but I'm just saying it if you are buying one in 2021 consider this3. No 5g : No 5g supported so if you are gonna keep this one for a long time consider this4. Accessories : Almost no accessories in box so you have to buy one separately and to be honest they are expensive.Altogether it's a great phone even in 2021.

At first I was sceptical about my purchase because I was shifting from Android to iOS but down the line this started to amaze me with most of the things.FEW THINGS worth mentioning are:Cons1. There is no call recording feature, in case you want one to be there.2. There is a 5W charger in box which takes 2.5 hours to charge.3. I couldn't find a way to take my backup from Android to iPhone. Whereas it is super easy to switch from Android to Android with apps like clone phone.4. This phone heats up when you are going to use it for the first time because it generally sets up everything, update software, open apps for the first time but that goes away with regular use.5. It takes time to adjust to iOS if you are a first timer.6. This phone is heavy.7. 60hz is okay if you haven't gone 90hz till now. 😉🤫You haven't used 90hz so you don't even know how it feels.Pros1. Battery backup is super in my usage.2. Camera's were as hyped.3. You will soon blend into iOS system and unlike android devices this UI is specific to a limited number of phones which makes it very refined.4. Wireless charging, Fast charging options.5. IP68 rating a must have.If you prefer Brand over value then go for Apple otherwise if you want value for money then do not spend on any Apple product these are not as good as they say they are. Andorid is leagues ahead in many areas which haven't even touched even pro variants of Apple. Also there is a freedom to do things on android, customize things the way you prefer.

I've been using this device since last 3 weeks and the experience has been great, I had 6s for the last 2 years and upgrading from it to 11 is just something else.Touch ID has been replaced with Face ID and it's quite handy but not during this pandemic since well all wear masks Face ID sucks at recognising you.Battery life is just phenomenonal considering what I've been getting on 6s was mere 3-4 hours but this iPhone 11 is on whole new level, Now I just charge it once a day and yes that's enough juice for the dayCameras has been the best thing of iPhones since last few years. Night mode and Ultra wide Camera is the best thing on this phone, But yes Pixel is still the king of photos in low light and Videography has been the area of iPhones !Screen is the weakest point one can argue on this device yes it's does not have to mind-boggling resolution figures but an awkward 1792*828 Res display. To be very frank you won't notice any difference while consuming content unless you put a OLED display device besides it, Ofcourse OLEDs are way better but still this display is enjoyable since apple calibrates their LCD displays precisely.OLED lovers can go for iPhone 12 !So fellas If you wanna enter Apple ecosystem with less to spend go for iPhone SE and if you wanna enjoy the latest full screen design with iOS 14 latest updates and gestures iPhone 11 is the best choiceiPhone XR not recommended since it's just way too old and not good value for money

Why I chose IPhone 11 over other cheap / good android phone?

- I didn't buy iPhone for the camera but it surprised me with the quality of photos and options to capture moments especially Live Photos, Loops, etc.-I am an avid app researcher, and I love App Store apps because of the quality of apps. I recently bought - Good Notes, Book Track, minimalist, etc.- I love the features like ""Login with Apple"", which allows me to signup without revealing my email ids.- Privacy is a huge benefit with all apple devices. I just love it, how it cares for my privacy.  # I stopped using chrome on my phone, I use Safari  # I have iCloud in place of Google Drive  # No SMS app. I depend on Apple Messages  # Reminder app is awesome and it integrates well with the calendar apps.  # Login with Apple saves a lot of time and also you can signup with a private email id (proxy email)  # Facial recognition while signing up is a great feature- I also own a Mac device, so it seamlessly connects with it - I can attend phone, reply or see SMS without much difficulty.Though I understand it is heavily priced but it is worth the price.My Past Experience:1. I had used iPhone (5s, 6) earlier for many years before this but I switched to One Plus (X, 3, and 5T) recently. I bought iPhone 11 post I start facing issues with my 5T in just 2 years of use.2. iPhone experience was much better in terms of the reliability of the phone.3. App Store Ecosystem is much better than Android (In India as well) - Apps are laggy in Android (may be because of device performance or app itself not sure)My decision to buy this phone was entirely based on the App Store Ecosystem.

The overall user experience is just phenomenal and if you’re first time iPhone user, you would feel this phone is out of the world.However there are few minor issues also compared to the flagship android phones. Most important of them all is the battery capacity, after moderate use of almost 1.5-2 years, I can get a maximum 12 to 15 hours of battery life on this phone. Everything else is just phenomenal and for first-time users it will feel like the smoothest phone ever.Pros -CameraUser experienceSoftware updatesApple ecosystemCons -Battery capacity after 1-2 yrs usage

There’s no complaint regarding software side as it is fluid as always.It is an iPhone so all the pros are there which we see in an iPhone.However, in 2021, it severely lacks behind in some department. Like the screen quality. It’s a good screen but seeing the competition it lacks a bit now. And feels dated too. Main camera sensor is very good. It struggles a bit in ultra wide in night only.My main conn is it’s been just one year and my battery health fell down to 87%. Which I think is a bit more than what I expected. So it used to get me through the day one year ago but now it’s almost 10-15% at the end of the day. That too at moderate use. I do not play games in this.It now tends to warm a bit too during browsing and using camera but not raising concerns.Large pdfs however crashes in between the scrolls. It might be software issue since I have now seen any lag elsewhere so I’m not blaming A13 Bionic for that.64 gb for me felt pretty sufficient and I’ve only reached half the memory till now.iPhone 11 is still a good phone especially until the 5G arrives. It is priced at 39k in great indian sale which according to me is an insane deal even now. For someone who wants to shift to iOS but are tight on budget I recommend them to go with this even in 2021 as it is an all rounder in every aspect.

The best decision of my life
","
From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.

Brutally honest review: Switched from ios to android and now to ios
","
Writing this review after 7 days of use. I have previously owned an iPhone 6s then switched to poco F1 and now iPhone 11.Pros: 1. Best battery life in an iPhone  - 3110 mAh2. Beautiful 3 cameras - 12 mps all (see attached photos - taken very casually )3. Ios 14 so smooth (4gb ram)4. Dual speakers sound really punchy.5. Apple face id is amazing and quick.6. Apple security and apps are so well optimised.7. Dual sim (e sim and physical).8. Easily synced all my data and got my all my folders and layout exactly as I had it on my iPhone 6s with the all the custom settings of the same.9. iMessage is very cool if you use it.10. No battery issue or heating as I read previously online, battery easily lasted a day or more.11. Bigger Lock Screen button than before (coming from iphone 6s)12. Premium feel phone13. Its an iphone14. Good resale valueCons:1. In face id you always have to swipe up physically to unlock phone (in my previous phone poco f1 it automatically after detecting my face would unlock and there was no need to swipe up)2. Minor software limitations as compared to android3. Apple original 3.5mm cable will cost you 1000 rs4. Little heavy after putting on spigen case (go for basic cases if you prefer a lighter phone)5. You cannot disable the setting that when the lock screen side button is pressed it will end the call if you press it. You have to refrain from pressing it while on call.Conclusion:I would personally rate this at 9.5/10If you like ios go for apple, if not go for android, it’s as easy as thatAnd as for me, I’m very much satisfied with this phone, got it at 55k.

Good phone but think carefully before buying

My rating for iPhone 111- Screen 4/5 - having good quality LCD screen with less PPI but no where compared to modern high PPI amoled panels.2- Camera- 5/5 -  just great.3- Built quality 5/54- Call/ voice -5/5- no issue at all.5- Face id- 3.5/5 -  no where compared to physical finger print reader, 20% times it fails to recognize your face and unlock process is itself not so smooth as you have to tap screen then swipe up to unlock where as for finger print reader just tap on reader and it unlocks the phone instantaneously. During Covid time, wearing mask and unlocking phone is so much pain as every time you have to remove your mask to get the face id work.6- Battery/ charging- 4.5/5 - battery is good, giving me 1 full  day backup in moderate use with more than 6 hr. SOT.7- Charging- 2/5 - it is weird that this 65K mobile supports fast charging but Apple is not giving 18W charger in the box, charging process is so slow and it takes like 3 hr to full charge with given charger, I use my ipad's 10W charger and it takes like 1.5 hr to full charge.6- Software- 4.5/5, iOS is smooth and using it is very pleasing experience but if you are switching from Android you will find some restrictions like can't direct trasfer files/photo/music/ videos via USB. Also I am missing call recording, duel app support and a physical finger print reader. Due to notch top status bar area is very limited, it would be great if we can see battery percentage and data speed in status bar.----overall It is a great phone but my advice is that  think twice before buying this expensive phone, as Amazon is no longer accepting return request.----

Amazing performer | Great photos | Good battery | Above Average Screen

I am moving from iphone 8 to iphone 11 and its a worthy upgrade. Even though my iphone 8 is still good and fast, I love using my iphone 11. Its a 85% iphone 11 pro at 65% of the price. So, in apple terms it is value for money.The good:- Fast processor! Same as iphone 11 pro/pro max- Awesome camera's (Again same as iphone 11pro and pro max except for the telephoto lens which can zoom 2x). Captures amazing low light pics. Ultra wide pics are good too! Best video camera ever in a phone.- Great battery backup. Lasts me a day. 1 hr gaming. A lot of browsing and chatting and some location tracking and still 15% at EOD.- iOS 13 is now mature and awesome to use. moved seamlessly from my iphone 8.The not so good:- Screen. Well its not an OLED! But still decent enough. Decent to look at. You wont feel its bad but its not great!- Front camera is only above average. Doesnt have a night mode. And the images are decent but not great again. Front wide angle is a joke.- 5W charger in box! Apple, I cannot hate you enough for this. You sell a 70k rs phone and give us a slow charger.UPDATE AFTER 1 YEAR with the device:- Still as good as new. No issues whatsoever. Used to play Pubg pre ban and it could run the highest settings without any lag!- The performance is great in all aspects even after an year.- I dropped it in sea while playing in Feb 2020 and found it after 20 mins. It survived 20 mins under 4 feet of salt water!!! I just washed it under fresh water as soon as I found it to remove salt from it, no issues faced whatsoever. It has been 8 months since that incident but the phone is doing great, infact as good as new!!!- Cannot think of an issue that I can highlight. Probably the lack of night mode in front camera is one but I dont use front camera that much so I am happy.

If you need an iOS device at low price, go for it. For camera freaks not recommended if you are into telephoto clicks because it doesn't have a telephoto lens. But best in its class. I do remember it had the best camera after after pixel 2 xl and huawei p30 pro. Good battery life. Gets you through the day with moderate use but do buy a 20 w charger. Ahead of times processor, no question about that. Screen goes upto 1080p 60hz, not recommended if you use a 120/90hz device already, you will get stuck at slow motion. nice speakers if you still listen to music on speaker...it has that iconic punch of a little base that every iPhone has. But I do recommend to go for the higher variants if not necessarily an emergency to have an iOS device. If you are okay with an android device I do recommend comparing it with others like OnePlus, samsung, nothing etc, once.

Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11.Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome.Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd.Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones.Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app.Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box.Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship.FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone.Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me.Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.

Video recording will be delightfulI’m not a gamer but I tried call of duty it’s giving a stunning performance!!Speedy access to all the apps best phone ever on performance!!!Con’sThere will be a light reflection on camera when it exposed to a high exposure!! Bt it’s usual in all mobile phone.No online download is allowed apple vl block every way you found Using it’s policyYou can say iPhone is for a professional use!!If you are a full time internet user then it’s fine on listening and watching songs and movies!!Call disconnect option can be in a better way!They won’t provide charger you have to buy separately!!!!Overall best for performance, camera, video recording, gaming!!I love this phone best phone ever!!!

Days if once you submitted and I submitted for 3 times imagine how it will be for me and the problem its not solving yet and costumer support ia like we don't have replacement policy and the amazon.in that's also saying the sam thing then whats the use of buying iphone that too this much costly we saved money for months together to buy a new phone and the company and the sellers are like we don't have replacement if replacement is not possible then they have to fix it as soon as possible but they are like there is no issue found. In device but I am facing the same issue again again and I have all the proofs also videos photos bills everything I have ......and the service centre made some scratches on screen and the company is saying it happens while repairing is that really needed ua to buy a new iphone that too costly ....... Better instead of buying apple iphone choose oneplus or any other brand phone .......worst ever experience with iphone , iphone service centre , appl costumer support , and mainly with amazone.in

Switched from Android to iOS after nearly a decade (using since 2011).Getting familiarised with the OS took some time (2-3 days). But, once that phase gets over, one can appreciate the overall stability and swiftness that comes with this phone.Battery backup is great. I can stretch upto 6-7 hours of screen on time (after restricting some unwanted background refresh).With regards to Camera and OS experience, I have NO issues.Now, some might point out to LCD display in this. However, after using it I must say that the quality of LCD is quite good and for a general user, it won’t make a much difference.But, If you are a person who want that a bit extra on display then go for iPhone 12 and later.One of the major factor for my switch was log-term Security and OS support.&, with this purchase I can certainly be confident of all major updates until 2025-26.I am confident that this can easily turn out to be a good phone in long run for a person like me who don’t have much high performance need.Even of you are a person that wants to be on the cutting edge of performance, then the A13 Bionic chip powering this phone will take care of your needs.

Writing my review after three days of usage… I recommend everyone to update the software to the latest version before using the phone as there may be heating issues when the mobile is used without updating the software…I got my delivery the very next day of ordering the iPhone…Thanks to Amazon’s one day delivery…The product came in a secured package and the packaging was awesome…The camera quality is excellent…There is no second choice when it comes to IPhone camera…Regarding battery life…I’m getting one day of battery life for a normal usage with few hours of YouTube usage and phone calls…Battery life is Good.Phone is super smooth without Any lag…If you have budget then go for IPhone 12 as that comes with A14 Bionic chip that will be faster than this A13 chip…No Touch ID(fingerprint reader)…FaceID works like charm…unlocks even in extremely dark environment…Only issue is you cannot unlock your phone when wearing face-mask😀Night mode is good but not up to the mark..You can find noise in the images with night mode turned on…Dual SIM card configuration…Primary physical SIM card and secondary sim is an e-sim…Update after three years. Battery health does not drain too fast. After nearly three years of usage my battery health is now at 84%. (If you have a proper recharge cycle)Will update the review after one month of usage…So far so good!

I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.The screen size is really cool.The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ❤️ Apple 🍎

Its a great product and all the features are just awsome smooth functions and with latest ios.got this deal at 49900/- only in amazon great india sale.thanks amazon for secured and fast delivery’.The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.and if yu want to shift from android to ios this is best oppertunity with this awsome device from applePhone got delivered at 19th  October (I pre-order it on 16th OCT  at 12 am ), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone  at a great dealEvery spec of this phone is ultimate no need to further upgrade to 12 waith for iphone 13 and 14 to come bcoz till then its best product and value for money an great indian saleCons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", if you are music lovers then go for airpods pro otherwise these are  good2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.or 12W charger I am using my ipad 12W charger to chage this and it charge my phone full in 1hr 15min which is great so better to buy 12W OR 18W original charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like ipad).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.Its just woooowTHANKS APPLE

Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will get use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to  be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.Videos are Super Stable ++.Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.Built quality solid.Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.

Best budget iPhone on the market
","
Everything is good. The only problem is that if you’re coming from an FHD+ resolution, you might have a slight dissatisfaction at watching high resolution videos. And the blacks are also not good as this is an LCD panel. I’m switching from a 3 yr+ old oneplus 5t and that has a better screen than this one. Another problem is that this is not 5G ready. But it doesn’t really matter as 5G ain’t coming till at least 2-3 yrs. Those are my only problems. Other than that, a fantastic phone. Insane performance, great camera, good battery life and an overall good all rounder. I got this for 39000. I say don’t buy if the cost is more than 40k. Below that price range, this is the best phone, period. Beats all the phones in it’s category(like the oneplus 8t, 9r, Samsung s20 FE). And if u have a lower budget then go for the iPhone XR(if u get it for <34k). Definitely better than the oneplus nord 2 and the other Samsung counterparts.

Good one but lacks the sharpness in photos
","
I previously used iPhone 6s 32 GB variant. It’s battery health became very poor and I had to charge it at least 4 times a day. . Also, the space was not enough.This is the reason I upgraded to iphone 11. . I expected lots of difference compared to 6s as it is 4 generations ahead. . To be frank, I didn’t see any difference compared to 6s in user interface(Slight difference only).Even, there is not much improvement in camera quality. . Video quality is really good compared to 6s. However , photo quality is similar to 6s with slightly better white balance.The phone is bit heavier as well.. It would take some time to accustom to it’s form factor and weightBattery lasts from morning till evening with moderate usage.You have to press volume up button and the screen lock button together to switch off and switch on the phone. . This is the worst implementation of apple. .This phone is good but not up to the level of hype it received. .

All that you need
","
I had an iphone plus and wanted to upgrade. Did consider Oneplus 8 pro, Galaxy s20 etc.. But then, I don't need all the fancy these phones offer. I never play any games and hardly watch high resol videos. So, my priority were and what this phone offered,- Good Call quality- Decent Battery life- Fast Charging (fed up of iphone 7 plus slow charging). Buy separate adaptor and charging is fast and good. Out of the box adaptor can go directly to dustbin- Durability - i plan to keep this for next 3 years at least. My iphone 5s is still a solid backup phone, which is 6+ yrs old- Big enough to have a good read of news, watsapp etc- Decent enough display. I don't watch movies etc on phone. Good enough for normal use- Decent camera - i am more of DSLR guy, hardly use mobile. But camera on these are exceptionally good. You can refer some youtube video.So, Iphone 11 has all this and more than enough for my daily needs. i don't miss extravagant display etc, may differ user to user. Secondly, I have Mac, so its better mix with smooth airdrop etc.If you are ardiant apple user, i don't think you will like Android interface overall, no matter how fancy they are. I have used and got back to iOS.

Easiest Phone to Review. Read further to get the gist
","
Pros :-Great camera! The best ever. You don’t need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage-Games run insanely well with high end graphics-Wireless Charging-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhonesCons:-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn’t agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don’t know why apple is being stupid on this-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing.

Was on the verge of nervous breakdown before opening the package

Like most of the people i too was worried about the product. What if i get a clone or soap or shampoo etc. Well nothing that happened and a beautiful phone was waiting inside. Packing was normal, nothing extraordinary yet secured one with pin and code thats need to match with the shipment. Thank you AMAZONComing to the phone, well what can i say, the moment i opened the box there was an instant connection, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.The phone is incredibly beautiful.Well am an android user for the past 7 years and this being my first ios device it felt nice.Having some problem but i think thats natural, will be getting used to ios very soon.Camera is awesome, night photography , dynamic range, you can never go wrong with this.With A13 bionic chip its still one of the best chip in the market, its smooth like butter.Multitasking is smooth with this. SOUND quality is awesome, you will not complain its crisp and loud.Battery life is good, one can get a full day back up easily with normal usage.The thing that needs to be kept in mind, this phone is slippery and one needs to get a back cover and the screen guard to protect it from fall and scratches.Will be updating more with coming days.......🙂

I had bought this I phone from Amazon and it was a genuine product as well. But the warranty was not activated and it required a lot of effort .

Wonderful phone at given price
","
I am writing this review after thorough use of phone and checking all the features for more than a month.The Pros:- Amazing back camera quality-Face ID is lightening fast. You won’t even know that a lock is there. All the banking apps integration with face time helps a lot and will refocus the need to remember password or MPIN.- iOS is beautifully designed- integration with Other Apple devices like Apple Watch, iPad and Mac. All the clicked photos instantly available iPad is wonderful feature.- They have focused very well and small things which improves the overall use experience greatly. For example, Photo management and features like geotagging, photo captions to search a photo easily.- Screen quality is wonderful and the PPI ratio is just perfet. Don’t listen to people complaining about it not having an OLED.- Even with 5W charger, the charging speed is fast and battery back up is excellent.- Lots of cases available ;)Cons:- Front camera is average.- Certain restrictions are there in iOS. Ie. File system and media management- I am facing an issue where when upload or download is going on in IGTV or Telegram, when I switch to other app, the download pause immediately. I have to keep the screen and app on.- No 3.5mm headphone jack- Apple gives only 5GB of iCloud storage. So if you are having multiple devices that Back Up on iCloud, you’ll have to buy extra space (Rs 75 per month for 50GB)Overall a wonderful purchase. Go for it.

Worth the money. A Lag free experience!
","
I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!Pros:1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!Cons:1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device.

iPhone 11 best iPhone deal
","
Well the first question is, is it worth buying iPhone 11, when 12 is just launched, well yes very much if you are using any earlier version, then at this price point (48k-3k hdfc card discount=45k) it was definitely!! Factor in your old iphone price, it comes around 40k, this was a deal worth taking!!Also, iphone 12 requires magsafe charger so add more to its price, plus 5G shall take atleast two more years to come, so not a good bargain for spending almost double.Back to iPhone 11, it is no doubt a superb phone..11 feels so much more suave and classy, so much better user interface with ios14, so improved battery backup, earlier iPhone models users will definitely feel the difference, superb selfie camera with studio light in portrait mode and much more..Only cons I felt is 5w charger supplied with it, which takes 3 hrs to charge the phone, if 18w charger can do the same in 1.5 hrs, why the same is not supplied? If Apple wants to give “amazing user experience” then it feels like a deal breaker, may be because of the fact that slow charging helps in prolonging the battery life, but then why option of 18w charger and shorten battery life, perhaps Apple also face the dilemma and done away with charger only now onwards..Overall iPhone 11 makes more sense then 12 at this price point and in the absence of 5G currently in India. Happy with the purchase and super fast delivery in less then 48 hours.🤘.

After analyzing for many months, finally took the decision to buy my first IPhone from Amazon. Kudos to Amazon, seller & delivery partner in prompt delivery as promised & in perfect condition. Below is my quick review after a month of usage -Pros1. Premium feel at hand & ease of use especially after coming a decade of being Android user.2. No battery heating or draining. Lasts for about 3days with very casual usage - office call, mails, few apps. Please note i have not installed any games or heavy intense apps.3. Camera quality is the best that i have experienced.4. Face ID works like charm & very useful in authentication while installing apps or view the notifications on lock screen.5. Call quality, data connection & connectivity felt immediately better compared to my earlier phone.Cons1. Only nick picking on the charger not being provided in this new version. IF you have any USB C charger at home, you can leverage the same to charge this phone since USB C cable is provided.2. Cannot use 3.5mm jack based headsets. Need Bluetooth headset or lightening port connectors.Per my experience, I would definitely recommend iPhone11 since i do not see any potential cons. I do not miss the 120Hz refresh or amoled screen while using the phone.

Everything is fine as expected from Apple. Camera is really good. The processor is fast. COD runs smoothly even at highest resolution with highest frame rates. Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight.  The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone. I might not go back to anroid device again if this device runs good for the next 3 years. Thank you Amazon for such quick delivery within 24hours. The seller Appario Retail private ltd has done a great job in terms of packaging and on time delivery.

This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.

Review after 1 week of use
","
I was a bit skeptical about the mixed reviews in Amazon. And fake iPhones getting delivered from Amazon in youtube. I ordered from the seller Darshita Electronics, this is my review after a week of use.The iPhone is genuine without a doubt thanks to Darshita electronics for that, and i got a 1 year in box warranty too, confirmed this from the apple care website.This is a great phone with minimal flaws.The build quality is very premium as you expect it from apple, The Videos are great, very impressed wit the night mode for photos. Performances is great all of the apps works flawlessly without a single lag. Face id works perfect in dark roomsThe small features apple provides like the keypad tone, ios14 features, shortcuts, siri and most importantly i don’t have to share my data with google you have a secure iCloud for that all this and more made me love this phone completely.The cons are the charger, it charges pretty slow with the 5w charger almost 3 hrs. And apple pushing you to buy their product’s like the apple watch or the airpods or a better fast charger in that case.Since the earphone in the box and charger have lightning cable you can't use earphones while charging.If you’re looking for a 1st time apple experience i suggest you go for it you will never regret.Peace

Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys!!

The most perfect Apple iPhone today. No doubt.
","
This was a dream come true for me. Apple iPhone 11 was on my wishlist for long. The phone was delivered to me neatly packed without any damage.  The phone was absolutely new piece. The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge.The bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.

I had been using Android mobiles before iPhone 11, after using my iPhone 11, I felt very bad that I wasted my time and money on Android phones.Reason to change from Android to iPhone - Privacy, security and few ads that were shown on Android were shocking, that time I felt like I should move away from Android.Why I Love iPhone?1) Easy navigation, it understands humans very well, it exactly does what we want to do / act next. amazing.2) 100% Privacy and security. I can kept my iphone at any place in my home or office, no one can see my messages / whatapp popups etc. Feeling relaxed.3) Good Camera,  equivalent to professional Canon/ Sony cameras. Half of my professional photography and video work is done on iPhone. It saves money too.4) Good battery life, User friendly system.5) Super fast system.

As expected From Apple everything feels primium. First time in my life I bought iPhone it feels sturdy and comfortable. Not too big not too short for my hands perfect feet as always Cameras are grade. I want to mention if any one wants to buy iphone for camera please do check-out Samsung S series also as Today in 📷 competition samsung S20 Ultra is best in camera than newly launched iphone 12 pro max. If you ar buying for video then go for iphone 12 series. And if you are a gamer and want to buy this phone then nice decision do for it just how many android gaming Phone came out no one can beat iphone in PUBG MOBILE gaming experience there absolutely no frame drop not a single till now. But In android there will be always this issue. I want to say if you want both performance and camera together to for it or only for gaming go for Xr. Iphone 11 not recommended Xr is less price and there is no such performance diff. Don't upgrade iphone until a big change not made my apple.like better refresh rate and ibuild PRO mode in camera more customisation options. Like that in INDIA didn't expect 5G till 2023 so that's why.Thank you 😊For reading my review.☮️ Out.✌️

Iphone vs One plus
","
Coming from android and with no fast charging out of the box.... battery sucksCamera is awesome.... only pixels come close but this phone has an edge over every other flagship in the market.... portraits are the bestFace recognition works 2 times out of 10 in the post covid world and so yeah i miss the fingerprint scanner.Ios is 10/10 conpared to android. Gives you the premium feel.Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phonesBuild quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more.

Battery Usage | Health
","
I am reviewing this product after 10 months.So far so good. My battery health is now 96% and i never charge it for more than 80% using 20w charger. So the battery is working nicely.The performance is overall positive. No lag No heating. The picture quality is looking nice. I never use this device for storage. Hence 64 GB is enough for my usage.However if you use cellular networks, it will suck your battery and make it drained.Important- Whoever use mobile internet instead of wifi, this phone battery will drain as much as possible and make you to charge it for many times than usual. Furthermore the battery health gets gradually decreased as well.

Read this before switching from Android
","
If are switching from Android here are the following things that will frustrate you in apple:1. Video recording doesnt have pause button2. Almost every app needs paid licence. Eg A proper pdf viewer3. Cant save files on a folder and use it in explorer.4. Settings of each app can only be accessed via settings and not the individual app. So eg if you are in camera app, need to change resolution, need to come out of it and change it in settings5. There is no select all button in most apps like messaging, gmail, gallery etc. happy ticking off each item6. Face id has this eventually annoying animation that cant be turned off.7. If you prefer call recording, it takes a periodically paid app to place a background conference call and record at its end to show your recorded calls8. The otg adapter is over 500 times more expensive than android otg adaptor.9. Similarly all accessories are more expensive than their value. They just provide a snob effect10. Sometimes you would wonder how to get to the previous screen without reaching to the far top left back button on screen. But dont worry there isnt and the gestures dont work. Eg open a product image on flipkart or amazon and try to close it. Will take some time to figure it out.11. Display resolution is nowhere close to the similar price ranged android phones12. The new back tap feature to take a screenshot etc often gets triggered when you keep the phone on a desk13. There is no keyboard that shows numbers on the top line. So we have to swap no. And letter keys. Imagine entering an alphanumeric captcha14. Cant have a blank home screen to highlight wallpaper15. No battery % on the notification bar16. If you have old mp3 songs, they cant be simply beamed from your old android to iphone, need to attach phone to a computer and import via itunes.17. And dont get me started on connecting to other phones, via bluetooth or nfc. Even if you some manage to get a file on iphone, theres a good chance itll be useless. I wanted to import contacts using vcf backups. Security that puts shackles on you own feet.18. Try changing iphone ringtone to your downloaded tune. Not possible unless we use a thirdparty app.19. Cant even select all text from a page with a single click. What is with you people and select all?But hey. I get to show off my new iphone 🤬

They say 'the Worlds best phone' don’t need any reviews. But still, I would like to share my experiences..I bought Iphone 11 White color 64Gb variant during the Amazon Oct Festive offer,It was delivered on time.There were limited color option because most of them were sold out or unavailable due high demand this days, but I do not regret, in-fact, I am happy with this color. Believe me or not, Iphones in white coming from there initial models like 4s and till date are Apples top selling - they looks classy & feels rich. White color does stand out professional.I almost grabbed this deal 47999 offer + additional 1800 off on HDFC card which bring down the price to almost 46200.This phone is super smooth, it gives an immense multitask and user interface experience. The other thing that makes me feel great is its Battery Life. This is a huge improvement done in any iPhone models till date.Camera is another best thing of iphone 11.Talking about the design and build quality, it is great. The Aluminum Build and Glass back make this device stand out in crowd.Apple have improved the sound & audio quality as-well. It has got the stereo speakers. The output is very balanced, loud and clear.Thanks to Amazon for there great service and deals they offer. Highly recommended!

I bought iPhone 64 gb black after lot of research and confusion from all the products in the market.This product I got at 48500 rs.I had lot of concerns regarding the seller.But, surprisingly the phone is genuine I checked the warranty and other details everything is good.Using the phone since few days(I don’t play any games).pros1) Amazon delivered it a day ahead of the actual delivery date. The delivery was excellent.2) Very efficient battery after one full charge it lasted almost a day after mild use and no battery heating issue as of now.3) voice quality of the calls is very good. Better than the android phone that I used before.4) picture quality from this phone camera is excellent.Cons1) moving from android to apple data transfer is a bit of hassle.2) display is a little bit low compared to iphone12 mini ( which I had originally planned to buy)3) no charger adapter( big con for me moving from android to iPhone)it’s a good buy for the regular usage a very solid looking good phone.

Left OnePlus for the first time
","
Readers,Earlier I was hesitant to buy an iPhone as 11 comes with LCD panel, I used to be a huge fan of OnePlus and was under the impression that 120 Hz would really make a difference but hands on heart- I’ve been using my iPhone for last 3 days and I am flabbergasted at how vivid the display of iPhone is that too LCD one!Now coming to delivery- Amazon never disappointsSeller- Appario Retail, received the original product and in good condition- No complaints. IDK why other users have issues with this retailerDeal- Thank You Amazon for bringing this product under Great Indian Festival otherwise I would have regretted for sureDon’t worry about 5G, is desh mein abhi 4G network bhi Puri tarah coverage nahin deta. 5G will take its own sweet time to hit the marketColour- Chose purple after speaking to at least 20 iPhone users and finally made the right decision- White and Black are too common for meThe only demerit of using an iPhone is that you can’t transfer old WhatsApp chat backup from your android device.Hope my review helps in decision making!

100% genuine.iPhone 11- White colour,128GB, 4GB Ram, Updated to iOS 14.I ordered it about a week ago(17th Oct) and Amazon made sure that I get the choice of color and storage I ordered. Took a few days to source the this for me. Received it on 23rd Oct. But I must be honest this is one of the best thing I could get on festival occasion and Diwali gift.I also ordered the 12 Watts charging adaptor for fast charging. The charging time reduces drastically to 1.5 hours to full 100% battery. Additionally, I updated the OS to iOS 14. Seems like the system optimized a bit to function faster post update.Sound quality is awesome, camera is top-notch, battery life seems good, Display is not OLED, but I am not much concerned.Checked the in package - Earpods, they work well. No sound breakage or disruption.Power adaptor - 5W - takes longer time to charge; but better use the 12W power adaptor if you purchase.Owning a iPhone is a dream for many. Thank you Amazon for making this dream happen.My iPhone was sourced from Darshita Aashiyana Private limited.

The most eye-catching
","
The iPhone 11 was a big surprise, packing more advanced technology (namely in the camera capabilities and the processing power under the hood) at a lower cost than the iPhone XR's price in 2018. It combines a large 6.1-inch display with a premium-feeling body, and comes in an array of colors too.The iPhone 11 isn't Apple's newest smartphone - the iPhone 12 takes that crown, launched alongside the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max. They're pretty similar smartphones in terms of design but have improved camera sensors, a newer chipset and flat, not curved, edges.The most eye-catching feature of the iPhone 11 is to the imaging capabilities: with two sensors on the rear, you can now take wider-angle snaps alongside the ‘normal’ main images. These sensors are 12MP each, and are raised from the rear of the phone in a square glass enclosure - which we’re not enamored with visually.The night mode is the most impressive part of the iPhone 11 imaging quality, bringing brightness and clarity to impossibly dark scenes, and the Portrait mode, defocusing the background, is improved on the new iPhone too.

Amazon + Apple = Trust + Quality
","
I am writing against all the negative reviews here. I have purchased iPhone 11 from Amazon sale on 23rd of Oct. If you see apple website only Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm mall are authorized to see apple products. I am purchasing smartphones since 2010 from Amazon and my experience is always awesome. It seems some conspiracy is going on against Amazon to tarnish it's goodwill in the market. If you see the recent incidents about fake apple products most of them are from Delhi, Noida,and UP. It's done my people working as a support staff. I  have exceptional experience specially with Amazon I will treat Amazon way better than Flipkart or any other online portal. They always deliver the product before time and you can trust them 200% as far as product quality and services are concerned. I won't write much about the product because it's apple it doesn't require any introduction. It's amazon + apple trust with quality so it's going to be one of the life time experience for everyone. If you have 50k budget for smartphone then blindly choose apple don't go with Android phones. It's quality that's what matter a lot.

Order It & Experience : Anything below 3 stars is fake/biased/dubious/hypothesis

Frankly, i was slightly sceptical in ordering 50k phone from Amazon given the 10k difference vis-a-vis apple store pricing, mainly due to some critical reviews/complaints seen on the review page and partially due to people recieving surf excel packets instead of lenovo laptop - however these variables did not affected the product in any way :Positives:Price Point : Brought this at ₹46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival.Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chipSecure : You close your eyes and face id won't unlock your phone.Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editingGaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes.Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here.What i Dislike:Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of ""Budget iPhone"" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ₹68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ₹23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:

This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.

After purchasing the iPhone 13, I’m genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here’s a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It’s clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it’s the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience.

Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts. Number pad does not detect contact unless complete number is typed.

I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!Screen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before. Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!Hanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.Battery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday – a definite win!Comfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.Image Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light. Selfies have never looked this good!Color: I went for the classic Midnight color, and it's elegant and timeless. The finish adds a touch of sophistication, and it doesn't attract fingerprints like some other phones I've had in the past.In summary, getting the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival was an absolute steal. From the incredible screen to the reliable battery life and stunning camera, it's exceeded my expectations. If you're on the fence, take the plunge – you won't be disappointed.

Writing this review after using the phone for 5 months.Pros- camera clicks amazing pictures, video recording is the best I've seen in a phone so far compared to my previous phones. Stable videos with no shaking- battery life is good. Lasts an entire day with medium use. I don't game on the phone. Charging is as quick as it is with phones that use USB C.- display is soo good. So bright- built is solid, dropped phone a couple of times once with the cover and once without and not even a scratch.- listening to music and watching videos is a hot cos of how good the speakers r. Crystal clear with the right amount of bass and treble.Cons- phone is a tad heavy and using it for hrs on a stretch can result in pain in the wrist or fingersGot the phone in Diwali sale on discount so bang for buck if u ask me

I tried to flip camera while recording but no facility is added here. You have to pause first then you can flip from back to front or vice versa it means you can't continue it, very awkward position. Iphone software should be upgraded so that we can make it go. It's very essential for a content creator.

IOS 17.5 (current version updated from 16.6)Thw worst thing as a ios user for me that the fear of update , i heared some updates get display issues battery drain issues , god sake i doesn't had any issues from ios updates , but till i care- device  was great, super handy for me, little feeling of weight .Display - The 60Hz refresh rate didn't felt badly form me cause i am used such kind of device before. - The brightness Range is so comfortable. - The 2160p60 HDR videos in youtube give blissful experianceBattery And charging - The charging time:- i took 1Hour to charge  from 20% to 91% using apple 20w original adapter and cable without any interruption(no electricity break or disconnection ,calls etc) - Battery backup - I am mostly maintain battery in btw 20% <-> 80% so i think this may get one day backup for me ,Average 5h screen on timeThe one day backup is just a advertisemnt advertisement label usaully we use, actually a day like  events,party,outing  we use -camera ,editing app, social media app more than usual use , that day i didn't get a satisfied backup . - Little temperature warming while charging , no heating issue- battery health after 6 month 98%-battery cycle count 194  after 6 monthPerfomance - Good perfomance for video editing ,photography , social media . (I am not a gamer ) Camera-  Even though i  felt some lag or stuck screens in some third party applications - The cinematic Mode is mind Blowing . i missed 13 pro or higher varients for zooming in this mode . - Actually i really miss pro variant for the tele lens and camera features while i using this . Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened . Buy the way it is a hardware issue one of the display provider company's batch may show the issues . but we customers cannot identify which company provides the hardaware.I will attach my battery analytics data screnshot photo here so you can better understand how the battery is good The ordering experience in the greate indian sale was worst . I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .As a whole i didn't recommend base models ,i felt i must have buy pro variant but for person who need ios in affordable price i recommend 13 is better than 14

Review after 1 week of usage
","
Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.

Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience

iPhone 15 A solid upgrade and value for money
","

It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14. DisplayThe iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.PerformanceThe iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.CameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.Battery lifeThe iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge.  Overall  The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.ProsNew design with rounded edgesMore powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 proNew 48-megapixel main cameraBrighter display with upto 2000 nits brightnessUSB C can be used for anythingDynamic IslandCons No 120hz display No Macro photography

The BEST iPhone EVERRRRRRR! : iPhone 15 review after 2 weeks of continuous use
","
The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.

I had an interesting experience with the new model. The corners are noticeably curvier compared to the previous version, making the device sleeker. Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home. I quickly grabbed my iPad, locked my device, and used the ‘Find My’ app to track down my phone. Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn’t very tech-savvy and couldn’t figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it’s not going anywhere.

Dynamic island -• As a first time experience, it is exiting to see a separated put notch hanging and videos playing around it. Gotta see its uses in long run.4. USB - C• Gives us option to use other android chargers when needed. Great relief for apple users. Don’t have to be extra careful while packing :-P5. Colour - i bought it for my wife and pink colour was perfect.Note: This review is considering my previous phone was iphone 12.

Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool tooPrice : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same .

If you don’t like using big sized phone , go for it. One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won’t recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!

Go for this without a doubt instead of the 14 pro or previous ones. The camera is really the better one than all the previous versions. If you’re willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (iOS is optimised and you won’t feel any difference if you’ve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn’t know unless you’ve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions.

Phone is overall a beast specially in terms of battery and camera it has improved a lot, display is also brighter compared to the old ones, a little upgrade in processor too and dynamic island is an add on to it which looks cool and will give you feel of a pro.There is nothing much difference between 60 and 120 hrtz considering the price because 60 hrtz of an iphone is much smoother than a android one.Im using this device from few days and only problem im facing that this phone is heating specially when you are updating to new ios so dont worry it happens when you update to newer ios.im Using 20 watt charger and its performing very well to my phone with little warm feeling which is normal due to fast charging.Dont think too much about battery health because you have spend a lot for this tech so use it without anxiety to its highest capacity.
