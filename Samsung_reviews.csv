S20- Better than Ultra!!
","
I'm coming from  S8. I didn't have any issues with the phone after three years, but dropped it and it wasn't worth replacing the screen vs finally upgrading. While slightly taller, this phone is very similar in size and use to that phone. The processor is blazing fast and it can handle anything I throw at it. Smart Switch by Samsung made transferring everything over to this phone incredibly easy. Samsung's UI is incredibly flexible and allows a lot of customization. The screen on this thing is beautiful and I like that they toned down the useless curved side screens. The centered hole punch on the front is great and much better than the S10. I also am in love with the 120hz refresh rate. I have always dropped my resolution down to 1080 anyway and with Samsung's incredible Amoled displays, you won't notice the difference in resolution. However, you will absolutely notice the 120hz refresh rate. After using it, you will never want a phone without it. The camera has been great. Honestly, most flagship phones have gotten so good that only the tech obsessed will notice the minor benefits and differences. This thing just works without doing anything to the settings. It takes great pictures in virtually every scenario, including night time. Regarding all the complaints, let's address those. First, I hate Verizon Wireless and all the bloatware and quirky things they CONSTANTLY do. However, their service in my area is superior so I like many use them. While it is disappointing that EVERY other carrier was able to get 12GB RAM and a microsd, Verizon claims it was to incorporate their supposedly better 5G. Well, in general, that's a stupid reason, and based on Verizon's track record, one that I don't believe at all. It is more likely that it is a cost saving measure. However, these phones are selling  lately and that makes the 8GB of RAM much more tolerable. You have all the tech you need from the bigger sibling at a fraction of the price in a more pocketable form factor, which is important to me (I prefer smaller phones). You get a top of the line flagship screen, camera, and processor. And unlike phones in the ""mid tier"" price range, this thing comes with 8GB instead of 4GB. I honestly wish the 5G wasn't a factor because it barely exists anywhere and won't be something I pay extra to take advantage of. But for the regular user, you won't notice the lack of RAM. The memory expansion is a little disappointing, but the 128GB of storage that it comes with in base model is plenty for most. In general, this is a fantastic phone that is selling for a great price. Yes, Verizon sucks, but the phone is still great and only the hyper sensitive techies will care at all about the concessions. You most likely won't notice any of the trade-offs in day to day use.

Nothing could be worst experience than this.

Nothing could be worst experience than this. Here is the thing - camera and build quality is wonderful, 120hz refresh rate and display is great. But it is a heater.Continuous use of camera or video heats it like nothing. It gives feeling that you hold it for few more minutes it will burn your fingers and palm.Strong no for this. You know Samsung does not give Snapdragon chip in India with this phone rather it is ""Exynos"" which is an inefficient chip and heats up the phone.No value for money, I thought heating problem will solve after few updates but no. It's a nightmare. Don't buy this.

Gorgeous & ergonomic form, strong build, brilliant display and a super-fluid operating system
","
When you take a S20 into your hand, it is basically a glass slab held by a metal frame. S20 is light, feels solid, dense and the grip feels comfortable for one hand use. I don't really fear that I might drop it & that's mainly because of its narrow form. When you wake the S20, the glass slab comes to life. Put your favourite pic on as wallpaper and see it come to life! Things move so so so smoothly on the screen thanks to it's amazing 120hz display. The fluidity feels unreal & soothing. Using gestures to move around on this phone is a delightful experience. Phone never gets slow, never stutters as it is pretty heavily loaded with memory & processing power. The camera is amazing and helps a novice photographer like myself take some pretty good shots for others to awe & wonder! (I have put some photos) Tons & tons of features in the phone, some of which I found pretty useful like screen recorder, bixby routines etc. Operating system is really really top notch. It's one of the best systems I have used (including iOS). Battery is decent, nothing extraordinary but they have a super useful MAXIMUM power saving mode to compensate. Charging is pretty fast but not as good as Dash charging.Gorgeous & ergonomic form, strong build, brilliant display and a super-fluid operating system makes S20 one of the best gadgets I have used alongside my 15 inch mac. You pay for the best experience & you get the best. There is nothing better out there as of now! 4 months with this phone & loving it every minute!

Good camera phone with average features at premium price
","
Review after 1.5 months of use. Body and look wise, it's fabulous. Easy to hold in hand. Battery life is average and requires you to charge your phone again if you are a video or game lover. I didn't liked the finger sensor at all. It's not smooth. I need to press harder to unlock my phone. Many time, it rejects. I liked the camera quality. You will love it. I also observed phone reboot multiple times with no reason. Also observed that phone automatically sends the error report to their site for unexpected reboot. Now a days, I am observing some lag in its performance. I would give rating as 3.5 with these pros and cons for a flagship phone that comes at such a premium price. Samsung also offered clear view cover offer for some selected customers but Amazon didn't provide this information in product description.

Review After 4 Days.
","
I bought My S20 Last week its been 4 day I am using this phone. The main problem with this phone is heating issue. If you are a gamer plz don't go for it. Phone get heated while playing games. Battery life is very less. Its a high-end mobile from Samsung but they are not considering 2 main USP of mobile phones battery and heat. Fingerprint reader is worse. After 2,3 attempts you can unlock the phone.Good things  its fast, smooth, compact, looks premium, Camera is wow.This is my 1st Samsung  phone lets see what else in it.

Powerpacked: everything is just about perfect.
","
*Reviewing after using it for 5 days*I had ditched Samsung after S2 and joined back with this beauty S20.If you are looking for right sized, compact yet as powerful phone, go for it. I myself  was confused  between S20 and S20+ but now very happy to opt S20. It reminds me of S2.Firstly I didn't want a Chinese phone so don't want to compare it with any of those. No compromise with security.I got it for 67k after discount. Color: cosmic gray.Box contents:1. Phone with scratch guard applied2. AKG type C earphones (they are good)3. Power adapter (super fast charging takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge the phone)4. Transparent case (which I didn't know and ordered Spiegen one as well)Pros:1. Camera: its amazing,  check out my Instagram page to see samples @the_real_hrgarage. Front camera  is good too, don't be skeptical about megapixels2. Display: the best that you get. 120 Hz takes you out of the world, however 60 Hz is butter smooth too. If you are fan of larger screens, go for S20+.3. Performance: no lag whatsoever even in bigger games4. Form factor: Perfectly proportioned and solid.5. Sleek design: just about right. Easy to handle with single hand and no worry of slipping out of hand.6. Edge display: love those notifications when screen glows around the edges7. One UI 2.0 doesn't disappoint infact it's much better and more customizable. I don't miss stock Android which I feared the most. I haven't  started using Bixby apart from it's routines so not much to add there.8. Water and dust resistant: must of an expensive phone.Cons:1. Gets heated but I think that  comes with the performance.2. Battery could have been better but nevermind we get super fast charging.3. Fingers print sensor: Sometimes asks you to press harder but you will get used to.To summarize, if you're like me, don't want to go Chinese brand and neither want to switch to an iPhone then S20 series is the way to go. It's premium, powerful and best of the class.

Masterpiece Galaxy S 20

This is my first premium phone and I am in Love with this.Pros:1- Display is out of the world you will not get this type of Display in any smartphone or TV. Samsung has done g8 job here.2- RAM management is good apps runs in background for long duration you don't need to reload again...3- Camera is doing decent job it is Good but not compare to Huawei P30 or or Pixel-4 but after those this will come better than iPhone 11 series in many scenarios. Front camera is Good takes good selfies. Rear camera has some good features this time like Single take..which is best feature so far.4- Speakers are loaud, Clear and crisp..5- Design is handy best Size for smartphone I love that on holding 😛Cons: Battery is draining quick but it is because of software issues which Samsung is going to Fix soon. Right now you need to change the phone in morning and evening/night if you are avg use.All sensors and software are pre-installed.My final recommendations are Go for this...you will love this..

It is a huge downgrade when compared to 865 variant - Edit - some improvements
","
So earlier samsung used to produce phones with exynos and snapdragon variants which were very similar in performance. However, this year the performance difference is huge the phone is about 20% slower and that is not even my main gripe.What makes is far worse is the battery runs down far quicker despite it being the slower variant, the phone heats up far quicker, it throttles and slows down even in video calls.The touted 120 hz refresh rate even switches back to 60 when the phone gets hot and that happens way too often on this variant. Even the camera quality is worse.So to sum it up-1. Bad performance  when compared to the other variant2. Bad battery life3. Bad photos4. Over heats-------------------------Edit - Writing this part on 11th April approx 1 month using the device. The battery has somehow gotten better and can last a day now quite easily. I had to reset the phone. The overheating issue also seems to have gotten better. Increasing a star but it still has those problems

Read this review before you buy.
","
First of all Delivery was really fast by amazon as always.*This review is going to be lengthy*I have been reading reviews here that how bad exynos processor is compared to snapdragon 865 but in my opinion the performance difference is minor. I saw a lot of reviews online and read multiple threads about this and everything was against exynos processor. I had to give a second thought on should I purchase this phone or not. But I purchased it a week ago and I'm really glad I did.People are testing games on this device and then complaining about battery life and the phone getting hot but I think there are a lot of phones out there to game on because to be honest not every PC or Laptop can run heavy games you have to buy a dedicated machine to play games on. Similarly this phone is not meant for gaming only. I know you're spending thousands on this device but if you want to game trust me this device isn't for you just go for asus rog phone if you want to play games. In my case I am getting around 5 hours of screen on time and the phone gets hot occasionally like while updating or charging and I have an iPhone X too which also gets hot while doing the same things so it's not a big deal. Finger print sensor is okay don't expect it to work same as physical finger print sensor.Camera quality is really good it can capture 8k videos and those look really sharp.The new UI (user interface) update ONE UI 2.1 combined with 120hz display on this device makes opening menus and closing apps buttery smooth.Samsung is known for it's displays but this display is incredibly sharp and vibrant.No headphone jack? Ya right there is no headphone jack in this device so better go for wireless earphones.Overall this phone is really awesome go for it. Plus this phone looks & feels really great in the hand I got a lot of compliments from people that it looks really beautiful and they also want a phone like this one.

Not a flagship. And very costly
","
I was using one plus 6t. After using for 2 years wanted to upgrade. Because of personal choice of boycott China.  Went for Samsung after 7 years. And what did I get.Pros:1. Beautiful  look.2. No lag3. Smooth interface.4. Multiple features.5. Superfast chargingCons:1. Pathetic battery backup2. Camera is similar to oneplus 6t. No new feature.3. 30x zoom lacks any clarity, the images are so Pixelated.4. The touch sensor is not so smooth.5. Face unlock is inferior to one plus 6t.6. Screen size is smaller.7. Notification  ringtones per app is not possible.8. Not a worthy upgrade. Should have gone for a series.Still won't suggest to buy one plus, vivo, oppo, redmi, realme, pocco.

Wait for more reviews and comments before buying!
","
I have to the say the 120Hz display is awesome. It definitely gives the feel that the phone is fasters and smoother. Camera is definitely in the top 3 but still not the best in this range. Need works on the fingerprint reader which is a bit slow which is against the general theme of the phone I would say. Battery life is just okay. It gets me through the day with my usage.And why I would say to wait for more reviews. I'm facing heating issues with normal usage. It went upto 39 degC with 10-15 min of VoLTE call and it reached a staggering 46 degC when I started recording 8K video and camera stoped itself saying temp is too high. I'm in talks with Amazon to get a replacement since I think the very least my device is faulty. Will update more on it here later.

Samsung's substandard Exynos dumpyard is India🙁
","
It's a perfect phone if it had the Snapdragon chip.I loved the phone but a chip which can't take load of a the phone is a joke .. paying for the flagship and Samsung cheating again with us a substandard chip for the same price .Result? Heating issues ,low battery,camera app freezes after 20 mins of usage due to excessive heating of phone after n number of updates it can't be solved as we already know the chip is never gonna be better .Not gonna buy a Samsung phone unless they change this exynos joke

The product is one of the best in class and one of the best Android mobile phone.Pros:1. Excellent camera performance.2. Premium looks.3. Most handy to use with the aspect ratio  it has.4. Best performance with the high end  games running without lag.5. Best displays you can get for any phone.Cons:1. Battery performance is not that great  with Exynos processor. Snapdragon  would have been a great deal. Last for  just a day with moderate use. 7/102. Fingerprint sensor. 8/10

Light and beautiful phone, beautiful display
","
The phone is perfect for my use. The 120Hz display is obviously the highlight - it's so smooth, you have to see it to believe it. The camera is good enough, though I don't see it as a significant upgrade over my three-year old S8.  I see a lot of complaints on overheating but I have not experienced this - probably because I am not a heavy gamer. I have streamed videos for ~2 hours at a stretch though and have not seen any overheating. Performance-wise again, I have not found anything to complain about. Few cons I can think of:1. The fingerprint sensor is very hit and miss, compared to previous iterations2. The speaker is absolutely horrible. The earphones have great sound quality though.3. No 3.5mm earphone slot. I've gotten used to the USB-C earphones, but some people may consider this a miss, especially if you want to charge the phone and use earphones at the same time.

Killer flagship, one of its kind.
","
Display - amazingly awesome, 120Hz @  FHD+ and 60HZ @ QHD+Camera- best in market, beating every  mobile out there.Performace-  I am reviewing this after using the phone for over more than a monthExynos is the worst processor we have got in this flagship, it even cant with stand with snapdragon 660 SOC.Heats very much even at normal usage, which further drains the battery swiftly.And when you play any game over phone, you barely will be able to hold the phone as a result of immense heat from the phone.Also lagging issues i facing nowadays which were not there earlier.comparable to snapdragon 865 it is 30% slower in performance.I would recommend this phone only when you are getting snapdragon SD 865 with it.This is the very bad decision of Samsung by not selling the phones with SD-865 in Asian region.

Personal Opinion and Small Review

Honestly I was waiting for this phone for a while, transitioning from a moto g5+ to this after 3 years was a great change. Here's my personal opinion:Display 9/10: Would've loved the option for 1440p120hz.Camera 10/10: There's really nothing to complain about.Battery 8/10: Could be better honestly saying, it barely lasts enough.Performance 9/10: Few hiccups here and there but that's about it, I actually don't remember a lot about it.Build Quality 10/10: Again there's nothing to complain about.Overall 9/10: Not perfect but nothing ever is but I'm not disappointed in my purchase.

A big shout out to amazon customer care. My S20 had been facing a lot of heating issues and I was geeting a screen on time of not more 3 hours with minimal usage. My phone got repalced without any hassles.It has a great camera and screen but the unit which i had got does not make me confident on consistently of units being delivered by Samsung.Got the galaxy buds on pre order offer and thats great too.

Samsung saved it's money by not providing different slots for charge & earphones.
","
May be camera is great but saddest part is that you can either charge the phone or use wired earphone -. Just one port for both.Also cannot be charged by any type of power bank.Both end of charging cable are similar.So you need to carry with you this charging cable & plug always.

Better value for Money
","
This version is distinctly better than my earlier S9, though Samsung could have done more on the battery life is about 14 hours which is still less than iphone 11 where Apple is promising whole day use.Finger print reader in S9 was better as it had a groove to fit the finger well, where as in S20 need to press it multiple times to get it through. Perhaps a future software update can resolve this.The camera is very good and stable. Love it.

No heating issue.

The screen utility is till the edges and has edge too. More screen area is enjoyable. The mobile comes with a thin scratch guard which protects the screen.The mobile is light and the color is so young and reflective, it has panache. The stereo speakers and 4k display make the video experience more interesting.The battery life is adequate and long. I prefer this placement of fingerprint sensor over the previous models as the on screen sensor is more easily accessible.Added bonus was the discount on galaxy buds+. The mobile is worth the money.

Major heating problem!

Overall the phone is really good. But it heats up like anything. It heats up a lot within 10-15 minutes of normal use, without even using the heavier apps. After a point it heats up so much so that your fingers start burning and you can’t old the phone anymore. It’s BIG NO NO! Please don’t buy this. I got Samsung for the first time and had high expectations but over heating is a major issue and very disappointing from a phone like s20. But I’m thankful to amazon for their amazing customer care service that they sent a technician to check the phone and later I was able to return it. So don’t buy s20 at all.

This is one of the better phones Samsung has launched in in its S series. a big screen, with great features overall and a fantastic camera. Plus really great earphone accessories. Definitely worth the buy. The only 2 drawbacks are the common C type port for the USB plug in - it prevents me from charging the phone and plugging in my earphones at the same time, and the bland colour choices that samsung went with.

Phone feels premium. Camera is great, videos too, expected from a flagship. Performance is good, display is great. Battery life is also good. Fingerprint reader needs to be improved. It's not consistent.Good to see that micro sd card support is also there if incase need to increase capacity. Also being IP68 WATER RESISTANT is handy in rainy weathers taking photos or videos.

Fantastic in everything

If you own this phone, there is no need for anything else. Starting with camera, the ultra wide angle and the zoom in feature is fantastic. Phone performs really well with 60hz setup and 120hz only required if you are actually using your phone for office. 8gb Ram is enough for performing most of the functions. It has really taken the mobility of using mobile phone to another level.

So, I am putting this review after using the phone for 3 months. Definitely, the display is class apart from rivals and120hz refresh rate is something which high in trend and I love it.Most importantly for me is the size of the phone. it's very compact and handy people who love the small phone, I highly recommend go with the Galaxy s20.

Overall shifting from iphone to Android wasn't easy but it was worth it , with heavy usage battery can last upto a full day with still some percent left.

Been an IPhone user all my life, moving to Samsung was a major jump. But this phone has way better features to explore compared to iPhone. Screen, camera, battery life all are way better than the iPhone xs I used to use. I would recommend this phone to everyone. Still lot to learn, so might update my comment a few months down the line.

The camera of this phone suffers from a very fubdamental problem. In Auto mode, it is unable to focus on close objects (Less than 10 cm away). As a result all close up photographs are blurry and out of focus. This is a hardware issue that users are facing across the world, which cannot be addressed with a software update. What is the spending of Rs.70,000 on a flagship phone which cannot even get the basics right.

Photos that rhis device has been able to click is just too good for this price. And the display is also good and its small size is like chotta packet badda dhamaka. Its 3x telephoto lens is also the best that could potentially beat iphone. It has 30x zoom and 8k woth 24 fps recording.Its cons are its overheating and battery. Its full charge lasts about 6 to 7 hours. That means you have to charge it twice a day.My review: if you want to click DSLR level pictures and record videos just go for it if you like compact devices.If you want to do hardcore things on phone like gaming and video editing etc you should go for oneplus 12r.

I have been using this device for more than a week.about battery: with time it is learing my usage pattern and as days pass by the battery backup is getting better.I was using Moto G60 and surely when I compare S22 battery with my earlier device, it stands no where, but the problem with consumer is that we are comparing the battery backup with others and ofcourse it is very less.However this goes on for a complete day easily with abundant of photography(I never, ever, ever play games and surely for gaming this device should be skipped)I used go for 2-3 days without charging my older mobile and this one I will have to charge before bed or most of the time next morning. As per my usage, this gives me completely satisfctory battery backup and someone should not break the deal for this reason. I would definitely suggest others to buy this, only know your usage first, study your screen on time pattern on older device.other than battery issue the mob does get heated up sometimes and that is normal, good thing to notice it does get bak cool very fast. Heating is not a deal breaker, it only gets warm but not actually heats.Rest be assured, this mob is the best in every other aspect screen and camera quality are surely better than iphone 13. Device is snappy and just the perfect form factor that I was loging for very long.I was flabbergasted by the quality of photographs that it captures.attaching some of them.

The Samsung S22 is a smartphone that offers a mix of impressive features alongside a couple of notable drawbacks.**Battery Life and Heating:** Unfortunately, the S22 falls short in the battery department, requiring 2-3 charges a day for heavy users. Additionally, it tends to heat up noticeably after prolonged usage, which can be concerning for some users.**Fingerprint Sensor:** On a positive note, the fingerprint sensor on the S22 is excellent, providing fast and reliable authentication.**Display:** The S22 boasts a stunning 120Hz AMOLED display that supports 4K video playback and HDR10+. With a maximum brightness of 1500 nits, it offers vibrant visuals that enhance the overall viewing experience.**Sound Quality:** Samsung delivers on audio quality with the S22's stereo speakers, providing immersive sound that surpasses many other smartphones on the market.**User Interface:** The device runs on One UI 6.1, offering a smooth and intuitive user experience with minimal bloatware applications, enhancing usability.**Camera:** The camera setup on the S22 is impressive, featuring a 50MP + 12MP + 10MP Triple Rear Camera with OIS and night mode. With a 30x optical zoom and the ability to record 4K videos with both front and rear cameras, it caters to photography enthusiasts.**Performance:** Powered by the Snapdragon 8Gen 1 processor, the S22 delivers fast and responsive performance, ensuring smooth multitasking and gaming experiences.**Durability:** Equipped with Gorilla Glass Victus+ and an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, the S22 offers durability and peace of mind to users.Overall, the Samsung S22 impresses with its display quality, camera performance, and user interface. However, its limited battery life and tendency to heat up may be significant concerns for potential buyers. If you can overlook these drawbacks, the S22 offers a premium smartphone experience with a plethora of features to enjoy.

Tinny Monstar with Weak Battery
","
This phone simply tinny monster (6.1 inch display) in terms of it's performance and various aspects. Camera simply pro grade, Display just marvelous, sound not loudest but immersive experience u can get, build quality just next level with steel made fram and gorilla glass victus plus protection to both front and back, performance just amazing with full of power by Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, 120 hrz display just butter smooth with 425 PPI & 1300 nits brightness (As we know about Samsung Display), so from every aspects I can give full marks except battery.The big flaw of this phone is battery, as power of this phone very high and consumption accordingly, capacity only 3700 mAh, so that if u are a heavy users then don't go for it, the gaming performance just awesome but due to the battery you can't play on prolonged bases, also it has little bit hitting issue (During Gaming or Heavy Tasking) but every phone it has now a days. For casual users it last whole day easily but heavy users wouldn't have get full day of battery life.I recommend for those people who are casual users like me, using for normal day to day use and wants a pro grade phone (Premium Flagship) for long term use (4 Years major Android Update & 3 years Security Update) in Android segment with branded (No Chinese) & tinny phone lovers (6.1 inch display)  then blindly go for it.

Best phone to purchase on a deal (High Time Samsung Works on Battery)
","
I'll first deal with the cons coz thats what everyone needs to know before buyingCons:* Battery Backup. The phone drains battery a little quicker. I easily saw battery percentage drop by 7% in 5 minutes while booking cabs.* Charging Speed - Takes almost 1.5 hours to fully charge on 25watt charger. High Time Samsung up their game in terms of chargers and charging time. Oppo Vivo One plus all have moved up to 65W/85W/120W chargers with warp speed. Samsung still stuck at 25W.* Heating - Phone gets pretty hot while taking photos and using camera / internet for a while. This indirectly drains the battery too.Pros:* Feature Loaded Phone. Has so many features that make our day to day work super easy.* Best UI experience provided by Samsung. Has One UI 4.1* One of the best Portrait shots I have clicked with this phone.* Best camera in this segment.* Premium exterior. Got the Green variant.* Sleek and Compact. Was using the Z Flip Earlier. Wanted to switch to a smaller phone.

There's not much to say about s22. But....Pros:1. Good Fingerprint scanner (works well and fast even with water on surface or fingers)2. A dynamic camera. Portrait image and videos are nice.3. 2K resolution Amoled screen and 120Hz. Screen does not disappoint in outdoors (max sunlight).4. One UI works well. Thanks to the fairly powerful processor.5. Easy to hold. Stylish design.Cons:1. A little lightweight.2. Battery drains quick. (Deal with it)These are the major Pros and Cons. But depending on the type of user it may vary. All in all it's a very good phone, it's just that if you compare it with the ultra you don't feel it's good deal. But the ultra has it's flaws too.

Camera Flagship with impoverished Battery
","
Review after use of 10 month usage:I bought this phone in sale in October-22, mainly for camera & it's compactness ignoring it's pathetic battery reviews. It's camera & especially night camera performance is of top notch, similar to iphone 13. I have uploaded the samples. All three cameras & front cam has night mode. OIS is great & works at FHD 30/60 FPS on main & ultra wide cam. You can shoot from 720p to 8k in various cameras. Portrait pics come awesome in all cameras. Colour reproduction is very natural.Performance wise it's a good phone with flagship SD 8 Gen-1. Its a power hungry processor. SD 8 Gen1 still lags behind apple's Bionic A15 in numbers. Well there was price difference of 10~15k when I purchased.One thing that Samsung is still lagging behind many brands is bettery performance. I'm not a gamer, but even with regular apps (Browsing/insta/Primevideo/Netflix) this phone gives meager 4~4½ hrs continuous usage & 5-8 hours intermittent usage (screen on + standby) depends on how you use it (Pic attached). 'Always-on-display' reduce battery life considerably. Samsung has provided app sleep system for reducing battery drain by background app, which works great. Maximum power saving mode is there, on there battery drain rate is 1% per hour in standby mode (pic attached)Charger that I use is of PD 3.0 standard by Dr. Vaku, which work great. Still take one hour (15 to 85 %) to juice-up. Consider buying power bank if you travel much.In-display Fingerprint sensor here is ultrasonic, which does not work easily with tempered glass based screen protector. One has to press little harder. Dirty & dry fingers are of no use. 4 out of 5 times it fails. But face unlock is very faster, so I use it.Android 13 & UI-5 is awesome. Many features like popup & multi screens etc can be used at a time without any lag. Samsung promised to provide updates for 5 Yr. Once I played Asphalt 9 Legends, game went on smoothly on Auto settings. Minor temperature rise observed. But processor consumed lot of battery quickly.July 2023 update : Now since 5G is available in my area for last 4-5 months & I'm jio 5g user (SA 3700 Mhz spectrum) and speeds are astonishing, in 500+ Mbps. I also used S23 for a day (friend of mine bought). Nothing MAJOR improvements.Verdict : Go for it if you are looking for compact flagship camera phone in 50k range.If you can satisfy yourself with only 2 cameras & can stretch your budget a bit for iphone 13 then go for it. Iphone 14 is only bit better than 13 but has big price tag

I'd say everything about this phone is great otherthan it's heating issue and battery life. It'll heat up while using camera and sometimes while charging.  I haven't installed any video games so idk about that part. Heating has always been an issue with Samsung so... I'm in love with the camera. Also the battery drains pretty fast if you're a heavy user. Overall I'd rate an 8.5/10 for this.

Low battery performance
","
Samsung S22 is a beast in performance but lacks in battery backup. It is not for gamers and heavy users. For normal usage phone will run for 4 to 4.5 hrs(screen on time) in a single charge. In power saving mode it will hold more battery. Camera is best in this price range. Considering the price it's better than IPhone. Android 12, one ui ver 06, gives amazing experience while using. As always Samsung is the best coming to display has 120htz refresh rate(better than iphone). Anyone can consider this phone if there is no problem charging it twice a day.

MOST PERFECT PHONE
","
Using from past 1.5 years. Previously I have used almost all highend model phones. But I have not seen a most perfect phone other than this. Compact, powerful processor, gorgeous display, fantastic camera, Samsung's bugless and perfect user friendly OneUI. I don't have any heating issues or battery backup issues as few are complaining. Note that I am not a gamer. But I use very much for calls in my business and screen on time is almost 4 to 6 hours a day. I get comfortable 1 day battery backup. I charge every day in the morning. From 20% to 100%, charging time required is approximately 45 minutes. I get this easily till next day morning. Cases for this phone is also plenty of varieties. The most perfect phone.

An average mobile phone from Samsung.
","
I would like to divide my review in below mentioned pros and cons based on my 5 months of usage.Pros:1) If you are looking for a handy phone in Android world look no forward than S22 as S23 is overpriced. In big billion day sale it might get cheaper.2) The screen quality is simply fab.3) The build quality is fantastic and premium.4) The one UI is totally optimised and security upgrades are regular.5) The 50mp rear camera is fantastic and after upgrade to one UI 5.1 Android 13 it gave more options to play with6) The optical Zoom camera and wide angle camera are great too and doesn't color shift much compared to main wide angle 50mp camera.Cons:1) The biggest con of this phone is it's horrendous battery backup. At home when I am on wifi network still I have to charge it every evening by 5 pm as it touches 30 percent from 100 percent in just 8 to 9 hours.2) if I use it with 2 sims battery drains much faster.3) 120hertz refresh rate I won't advise for outside the home usage when mobile will run sim through internet. It drains battery faster.4) Auto brightness though very well calibrated I found that manual control on screen brightness is better to conserve battery.5) The mobile has heating issues which I believe is a issue with all phones having 8 gen 1 processor.6) The front camera is average and struggles in low light.7) Though back cameras are awesome but still they struggle very badly if pointing at sun. They couldn't control glare when there are harsh lights behind.8) Videos have jitteryness at times and mobile heats up like hell during 4k video recording.It's only for people like me who doesn't do gaming or too much social media. If you could switch to iOS then iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 are much better buy than Samsung S22 or even Samsung S23

Best Android phone with few compromises
","
Pro:Samsung Galaxy S series offers the best Android experience available.(Pixels can be a close competition in software and camera areas)Best hardware.Mind-blowing display, fingerprint reader and haptics.Throw any task and it will surpass your expectations.If you are searching for a compact phone with top notch hardware and performance, nothing comes close to S22(now there's S23, but considering the price). These are the reasons I chose this over Pixel 7.Great speakers.Fantastic cameras. Though it's not my use case. I mainly use my phone a productive tool and utility yo manage my work and personal tasks.One UI is great with little drawbacks here and there, only when you go into nitpicking mode.The green color looks amazing.Cons:SD 8 Gen 1A performant processor but very power hungry.This affects the battery life and also causes heating issues.I was well aware and thought it won't bother much since I don't use this for heavy tasks as gaming and streaming, but it does.I carry charger everywhere hence seldom face issues with battery but I have to charge it twice before ending the day.Heating is something I can't do anything about.Another issue is that the back glass is scratch magnet.It looks so classy that I wanted to use it without cover but got 2 noticable scratches in just 3 days of use.I would suggest to wait for S23 to be cheaper.Since they have fixed both major issues in it.

I got the product delivered on the correct date so kudos to Amazon👍 there is no open delivery option so record the unboxing video nonstop for return purpose.Phone : compact, display is just 😘, camera is damn good.Battery will take 3-4 days to adjust to my usage so there will be battery drain quickly initially but it will get adapted over time( my friend has a s23 ultra and this is what he told me where he only got 4 Hr screen on time initially and later 7 hrs)Totally happy with the purchase👍👍

Beware with One Issue
","
Pros:1) Compact and very powerful performance phone due to Snapdragon processor.2) Excellent display with wonderfully vibrant colours. Samsung displays cannot be compared to any phones, including premium smartphones like iPhone Pro, OnePlus Pro, etc. When comes to display, Samsung is Samsung.3) Excellent build quality with matte finish glass and steel frame with Gorilla Glass Victus + on both sides.Cons:1) Beware! All Samsung dual speaker phones have one peculiar issue. During the calls, if the loud speaker is turned on, top speaker produces voice only 10-20% of a sentence and bottom speaker produces complete sentence. So this means, top speaker voice breaks. I went to Samsung Service Centre and the problem I found even with the service agents smartphones. I tested with Samsung S10, S20+, S20 Ultra. The service guys phones, themselves, have this problem. And they said that they can't do anything. I called Samsung service centre also, for which they said that they will escalate the issue but of no use. So those who want to speak in loud speaker mode, beware of this. Of course, when comes to playing multimedia content, both the speakers produce sound without problem. This happens only with calls.2) 100% battery lasts for a day if the usage is moderate and not heavy (that too by uninstalling all the bloatwares and disabling many features like Samsung Pay, Galaxy, Edge, Always on display, etc.)3) There is no charger in the box. One can adjust with this, IF THE PHONE IS CHARGED FASTER with other fast chargers. But the nonsensical thing is, it charges very slowly with other chargers even though if it is high-speed chargers. I tested with OnePlus 80W charger, 30W dash charger and MI fast charger. Our charger-less Samsung phone is charging very slow with all the chargers. So this means, we have to buy charger separately without compromise. I really don't know how can they be so merciless to not provide charger after charging such a huge amount.This phone is only for those who desperately want compact phone with fully loaded features, who use phone moderately. This is the only option.

This is clearly a winner in most categories and ticks most of the boxes that one would expect from a flagship.The form factor is definitely the highlight. It's ergonomic and comfortable to use.The UI has evolved and definitely become one of the best in terms of functionality and oh !! boy that DISPLAY!!!There is no competition to Samsung in the Android mkt there .The camera 📸 is definitely worthy of the hype.Having said that ,the software does glitch and stutter every now and then ( even after the latest OUI 5.0 and A v13 update).But the biggest concern that Samsung really needs to adress and work on very seriously is the battery dpt.It's inadequate and poor for the catagory it's in and  price you are paying  . Work on some new battery technology, faster charging speed  or software mgmt that can make it last for at least 12-14 hrs without having to compromise on the functionality.The handset does get warm ( particularly on the top left corner and back side ) but nothing major.PS : Samsung can definitely add the travel charger with the box, you don't have to blindly copy your competitor,ya know .

The phone sure looks good and has good feature, but idk what it is with these high range brands not providing what is required for the phone. Charger and back cover is something basic and also there is no app lock feature in it, that mid range brands like MI oppo vivo also provide.I got a C to C type cable that I cant even connect to the adapter I already have.

If You are Not a Heavy User, You'll Love it
","
I've been using this device for just around 4 days now and for my usage, I love it! It's quite difficult to get a powerful, yet compact phone these days, and this phone fits that niche. The design is awesome and feels premium. I must say I like the designs of the regular S22/S22+ more than the Ultra this year. The display is gorgeous. You get a dependable camera system that takes really good pictures and videos in most situations, and the speakers are quite good. Additionally, Samsung is promising 4 years of Android updates, which is very important for me. I just love how the phone feels in the hand, and if you are a fan of compact phones, you'll love it too.However, not everything is hunky-dory of course. The battery life is only average, and that's for a light user like me. If you play games for long or take a lot of photos and videos regularly, you'll have to charge it twice a day. The phone also gets quite warm under sustained workloads. Let's see if Samsung can improve some of these issues with upcoming updates.Overall, go for it only if you are a fan of compact phones and a light user.

Pitch-Perfect!
","
I am using an 'S' series phone after many long years. I was using 'A' series phones and other brand mobiles. This is undoubtedly the best phone I've used till now. The compact form factor is definitely the most lovable thing about this phone. Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is also a top-notch processor but yeah this mobile does get heated while charging/gaming but I think that's quite common to all the mobile brands as it gets cold very quickly also and does not lag a bit. Performance is snappy whether you play games or not and file transfer speed is quite impressive. The camera performance is impeccable no doubt, I've attached the photos with this review, you can check. I loved the detailing of the photos. As Samsung's display is always superb it's the same here also and quite color accurate this time. Other factors like call reception, sound, etc are very good as this is an expensive device and behaves like one. The battery is decent, users are complaining about it but accept the fact that people have used high mAH battery devices(for example 5000mAH) for a long time and they're expective that much backup which is impossible. Go and check out Apple, Pixel devices, even though they're providing lesser batteries for their so-called ""Mini"" flagship variant. In my case, I'm not a heavy user and the battery lasts almost a day for me. If you are a gamer person or stream OTT content all day and don't want a charge your device that much then add more bucks and go for Ultra. If you want a beautiful & COMPACT gadget with flagship performance then go for this one, this is the best out in the market at this moment. Thanks to Samsung India and Amazon India for this amazing experience.

All good except battery life
","
I like everything about this phone except the battery. For all the power that is wrapped up in this phone, it's really light weight and it's one of the few phones that you can operate in just one hand for almost all tasks and transactions. There is no lag in day to day operations and everything feels smooth. The interface is intuitive as is expected of a Samsung phone. Call quality is quite good and I've so far not had any drops even in low signal areas. The look and feel of the phone is premium. From the photos taken so far there is nothing yet that is disappointing. I'm not an avid gamer and thus yet to test the phone for playing games. The battery juices out quickly but better life can be extended by setting screen refresh rate to 60Hz and switching off notifications for unwanted apps. In standby mode, battery does last long. All in all, this phone ticks all the boxes for me. At the current sale price, totally recommended.

If you are an executive and not a heavy user, blindly go for it👍 iphone killer and deal breaker
","
I was confused about S22 and iphone 12, and i went for S22 which i am happy. I always loved compact phones, which can be held in hand or stored in pocket easily. This phone is a tiny monster, equipped with camera lenses that are on par or even better than the iphone 13. But it has also drawbacks, mainly battery and heating issue on heavy usage. Well, thats common in flagship mobiles, thanks to snapdragon 8gen1😀. So be equipped with a power bank.However, it scores well in camera segment, and for an average user like me, the battery life is ok. I am also attaching battery usage screenshots, i am getting about 20hr backup, with under 5 hr screen on time. I have used camera moderately during the period. May be battery life will be improved, since usually all app data are retrieved from cloud in the first charge cycle. However, can only tell about battery after 2 weeks after the learning process is complete. During my sleeping period with wifi on, only about 4-5% is drained overnight. To get better battery, manually set refresh rate to 60hz. Loving the product👍👍👍NB: If you ever buy a BMW, Mercedez or audi, never complain about its fuel economy and engine heat😀. The same applies here. It is a powerpacked mobile.  You can always carry a power bank around in case on long journeys.

Fantastic Phone for the Price (Android : The open source King)
","
If you want a good sturdy, well built phone, with a fantastic user experience, go for it. However, you must keep in mind that, this does not come with great battery back up, as a Samsung Galaxy S 22+ would be able to provide. A power user might feel that the battery is just inadequate, but not too much. But these days if you are a avid gamer and browse, watch a lot of videos all day, then believe me no phone lasts more than a day.If you are a Normal user, then this is a perfect phone for you.This gives you the experience of owning a High end phone, with a great user experience.Also the camera is Incredible, Cant beat it at this price.It easily trumps the more expensive orange pro phones being sold (free advise: invest in gold bonds instead) of the current or prev generation, which are almost double or triple the price. As it is better to invest in a high end camera system instead.Pros:Android User experience.Crisp call quality.built qualityrear triple cameraselfie camerasize is just perfectNo heating issuesThe bluetooth head phones just come to life.Cons:nothing as of now. If you have to nitpick then - it just has a 3700 mah battery.

I bought it for 50k with 12 months no Cost EMI which is basically the best deal of this season. The reason I chose S22 is because it is handy and fits in the pocket.First thing first. battery life is a bit low. But it is working well for me as I don't play games or extensively social media. Also, the phone heats up a lot in doing anything processor extensive task.The screen quality is amazing and dark mode enhances the experience and battery life as well. LOL. The new One UI 5 further bought some usable features and the overall software experience is really good.Camera quality is great as it features flagship-level tech. Telephoto lens is another hot shot.

Speakers do the job well enough. The internals are the latest and greatest from Qualcomm but because of the phones small size it tends to warm up a bit on heavy use. My biggest and only complaint would be the battery. It's PATHETIC! 3700 isn't sufficient in today's day and age. Other than that if your priority is light browsing and business use. It's a great buy! GAMERS STAY AWAY!!

It might be really early for me to write anything about this one as it has only been two days I have purchased it.Samsung has evolved just like we humans and any other smart objects , things , people .The optimisation has never been so crisp smooth and pleasurable before with android ever.Android and specifically samsung has always tried and somehow also succeeded in try to deliver a great product but just because of the hardware and software integration of the iPhone so good , Android has always been one point behind.But this time I'm happy to say that samsung is ahead specially with this phone.The only issue is the battery 🔋  it's a power hungry machine which I don't know , could have been better with a bigger battery but I m personally Ok because I have my chargers and power banks with me always.Really happy to buy s22 forgot to say , according ro me this is the perfect size of a smart.

A top notched device in it's segment.

Way better than the iphone13 I had. Honestly, just beauty in every snap.Display is super bright and clear and smooth and responsive.Haven't tried heavy gaming yet cuz, it's only been a week but, won't worry because of the 8th Gen1 processor it has. 😆Got the Green Colour and it looks stunning.Devjce Manufacturing was last month Sept.(Con: Paint finishing seems a bit poor as my camera area paint got brushed off and the silver aluminum is visible, could've done a more rigid finish)Overall a Gorgeous, Stunning, Amazing, Great Device.

I was looking for a phone that fits my small palm all these years. And I finally found one that I can afford. This is the best phone I owned in my life and I really love how it fits so easily. I was fed up with the screen size on phones going up year by year. I am not a fan of iPhone so this was the best choice for me. Camera is excellent and the build quality is superb. Battery backup maybe the only area of concern but it depends on your usage and it charges pretty fast, so not a deal breaker for me.

The phone is a nice size at 6.1 inches and has an excellent display and equally amazing camera. The battery life however is dismal, being identical at 3 days old to my 3-year-old Huawei. The features are good but ergonomics could be better.I believe Sony phones feel the best but, unfortunately, they aren't here anymore. Still at half the price of the iPhone 13 Pro, the other phone I was looking at which is the same size, it makes for a better deal for those who use a Windows laptop.Charger not included, although it does come with a Type C-Type C cable.

The best Android phone I've used till now.
","
Take my word this is the smoothest and premium Android phone I've ever used in my life. I was an apple fan boy due to the iOS optimization and better security features. But later i came to know about Samsung Knox which is the best security feature you can get in the industry. I considered iphone 13 before this but for that price you're not even getting a 120hz display.In s22 this is the smoothest display I've ever experienced this is much fluid comparing with other brands 120hz displays. Camera is top notch. This is what I was expecting from an Android phone.The only downside i felt is the battery capacity which is just 3700, initially the draining was fast but after 2-3 days the OS optimised the battery and now I'm getting better battery backup, but if you're a hard user i would suggest you to go for s22 plus.

Good phone terrible battery

Overall good fone, used for >1 yr and faced no challenges. But battery is really poor. Am charging my phone every 5-6 hrs. Once battery is under 30% it discharges soo fast. Will not recommend anyone to buy only n only because of bad battery life.

One of the best flagships android phone
","
The phone really feels premium, camera is superb, but battery is sufficient to give you 1 day backup if you are not a heavy user or else it will give you 15 to 18 hrs of backup. Rest is superb, fingerprint is super fast, processor sometimes get hot but its thermal is well maintained. If you're are going for this phone take it. See if the phone is packed with powerful components then its will be hungry for power so if you go to battery drain test all of them will perform similar. Yes i have seen for s22+ and ultra also.. s22+ just gave half hour extra backup and ultra 1 hr its not much.. The phone is compact and I liked it very much.

Perfect sized flagship experience
","
The experience of using this phone is uncomparable in android.Pros -- perfect sized flagship for my one hand usage- Excellent screen, hence superior media playing experience especially on Netflix- premium in hand experience, rather i often take the phone out of case to enjoy its in hand feel- flagship camera and video recording- smooth UI- long term OS and Security updates.Cons -- battery life is less. I often work from home so no issues for me. But someone working on field may find it to be a deal breaker- device used to heat up in first week. After April update i feel the heating is less.Only phone that can compete with S22 is Iphone13. To get max benifit of apple product you need to be deeply invested in their ecosystem. Hence I preffered S22 over iphone13. Quite happy with my S22.

Green color on this device feels exotic. Best in class display, camera, with all up to date latest flagship features. Feels really good in hand and design is pretty compact. Best of Android from Samsung. No doubt.Amazon delivery was fast and packing was good, with assured original products as always from Appario seller.Only issues are battery life and heating problem.

The phone feels great in hands for a flagship level.  Great build quality. Feels sturdy and premium with polished sides and matte glass back finish. The phone scores well in all aspects except for battery life. Again it depends on your usage. For a person who uses mobile a lot, this isn’t for them. Better to go for S22+ or iPhone if they’re in ur budget.

After reading the reviews here I was doubting on the battery duration. But then I thought technically that this battery is having higher mah than my galaxy note 8 so it would be better for me.. And yes it lasts long.. Morning to night and I use this for calls.. Youtube.. Games.. It is a good handy phone no doubt.. Connection to my buds 2 pro and galaxy watch is also seamless.. What else do you need... Chota pack bada dhamaal.. Go for it.. Easy EMI also helped me to get the phone easily...

","
Camera image quality is awesome compared to other flagships. The phone overheats a little when taking photos. Performance is good while playing games and general usage. Only problem in my opinion is the famous shutter lag in s22 series. You cannot take images of moving target since there os a huge delay between pressing camera button and photo taken by camera. Must resolve this with an update. Otherwise everything good compared to previous generation.I owned an s10 plus...

Considering the battery life is low which needs to be charged in the evenings everyday, no other major drawbacks you can find in this phone. Very handy and rich looking one. All needed features are top notch. I wish there was a hybrid slot for the microSD card. Best value for money flagship phone i suppose but not a gaming phone.  Lastly, the phone gets heated for gaming (clash royale) which i usually play, that's a bit annoying 🙄. Camera is exceptionally good 👍. No charger adapter provided, probably you should buy one for around 2k or even less.

I migrated from Iphone 11 and have used OnePlus in the past so I was hoping that Samsung's flagship wi be a bit betterProTo be fair, Camera is good, so are the colours and software functions.ConsBattery drain is phenomenal, can't use 120 hz refresh rate due to this. Watch a couple of videos and battery crashes. Feels like iPhone 6 era. The processor optimisation makes the phone suboptimal. This is no where close to 3 old year iPhone.. only better thing is it's an android

Everything in this phone is great. Except the battery backup. I have never seen a flagship phone with this kind of battery performance. Its the only con in this phone you have to charge almost 2 times a day and trust me i am a very light user. If you can compromise in the battery section then rest things are very good. If battery is your concern then go for s22 plus.

Camera is awesome. Coming mostly as an user for iPhone for generations, this one is my first flagship possession from Samsung.Using iPhone 12, S22 comes at per in terms of Camera of iPhone 12 and I think it’s even better. Screen is much much brighter than iPhone 12. Performance wise is ok for me for emails, browsing and music. Can comment further with more time. Size wise is very convenient both to carry and also work. This fits in my phone tray in car and Android Auto is a charm with MID directions in Civic.What I hate is finger print sensor. It does not work most of the times with Spigen screen guard. After initial set up, I have stopped using it.

- Display: The top-notch display boasts an impressive 1700 nits, ensuring visibility even in direct sunlight. The 120Hz refresh rate, offering super-smooth visuals, can be adjusted to 60Hz for power-saving purposes. The nearly bezel-less design enhances the immersive experience, especially for users transitioning from larger phones.- Speakers: The speakers deliver a loud and crisp audio experience. While I primarily rely on headphones, I have received no complaints about the speaker performance.- Camera: The camera's exceptional capabilities stand out, effortlessly capturing fast-moving objects and producing crisp, vivid HDR images. The default camera software eliminates the need for third-party mods, providing realistic and high-quality photos. Remarkable video stabilization is evident in a 4K 60 video taken in challenging conditions. The selfie camera excels in capturing realistic and unenhanced images, with portrait mode being a highlight for both main and selfie cameras.- Design: As my inaugural Samsung flagship device, the S23 impresses with its premium feel and aesthetic. The Phantom Black color adds a touch of sophistication, and the compact, lightweight design, though slippery, becomes manageable with a case. Ensure to acquire an ultrasonic-compatible tempered glass, or the fingerprint reader won't function.- Battery: With normal usage, the phone consistently lasts over a day. During testing, I achieved over 6 hours of screen time, with the phone lasting 16 hours from 85% to 0%. While the phone can warm up during intensive tasks, wireless charging is a convenient feature, even though I haven't extensively utilized it.- One UI: The clean and appealing One UI allows for extensive customization, including the lock screen. However, the absence of an integrated App Lock is a minor drawback, and efforts to secure apps have proven unsuccessful.- Cross Compatibility: The integration with Windows, exemplified by the ""Your Phone"" app, sets the S23 apart. Compatibility with other Samsung devices, such as the Watch4 and headphones supporting LDAC 990kbps, enhances the overall experience.- Overall: Priced around 50-55k, the S23 stands as a compelling choice. Its unparalleled features make it the best option in the market as of this review, providing a seamless experience for users seeking a flagship device.

performance

I recently had the opportunity to experience the Samsung S23 phone, and I must say, it's a remarkable device that combines style, functionality, and performance. Here's my comprehensive review:Design and Build:The Samsung S23 boasts a sleek and modern design that immediately catches the eye. Its slim profile, curved edges, and choice of attractive colors make it a fashionable accessory. The build quality is excellent, providing a reassuring sturdiness without feeling bulky. The phone is comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display:The phone's display is a standout feature. The S23 features a vibrant and immersive Super AMOLED display that brings content to life. The colors are rich and vivid, and the Full HD+ resolution ensures sharp visuals. Whether you're watching videos, browsing the web, or playing games, the display is a visual treat.Performance:Powered by a capable processor and ample RAM, the Samsung S23 delivers snappy performance. Apps open quickly, multitasking is a breeze, and demanding tasks run smoothly. It handles gaming with ease, offering a lag-free and enjoyable experience. This phone is well-suited for both productivity and entertainment.Camera:The camera setup on the S23 is impressive. The primary camera captures detailed and vibrant photos in various lighting conditions. The inclusion of multiple lenses, including an ultra-wide and macro lens, adds versatility to your photography. Selfies also shine with the front-facing camera. The camera app offers a range of features and shooting modes to unleash your creativity.Battery Life:The battery life on the Samsung S23 is commendable. It easily lasts a full day of typical use, and even with heavy usage, it provides reliable endurance. The phone supports fast charging, which means you can quickly top up the battery when needed.Software:Samsung's One UI, built on Android, provides a user-friendly and feature-rich experience. It offers customization options, a clean interface, and a host of useful software additions. Frequent software updates from Samsung ensure that your device remains up-to-date and secure.Connectivity:The S23 comes with 5G support, ensuring that you stay connected at high speeds. It also offers features like NFC for mobile payments and an array of sensors for added functionality.Security:Biometric security options, including a fast and accurate fingerprint scanner and facial recognition, make unlocking the phone convenient and secure.Storage:Ample onboard storage and expandable storage options mean you won't run out of space for your apps, photos, and media.In summary, the Samsung S23 is a standout smartphone that impresses on multiple fronts.

Very handy and powerful device
","
The software has niggling issues, though, and when you approach Samsung, you're told it's a feature and not a bug.Like when you switch data, it goes to 5G automatically and you've to deselect it every time. 5G causes the phone to heat up and the battery to be consumed faster.Autocorrect remembers nonsensical mistyped words and replaces genuine words with these very often. If you delete them, they reappear again the next time around.If you connect any device on bluetooth, my music app automatically starts playing the music.But the battery life is decent and the camera is good. An amateur like me manages to click decent photos. The size is small and manageable unlike most new phones, which are like notepads. And so far, I have not seen it hang.

The perfect beast
","
This phone is a pefect upgrade from my old One plus. I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that, processor used in s22 - Snapdragon 8 gen1 is inefficient (not to be confused with 8+ gen1, 8gen 1 is made by samsung foundary, 8+gen 1 is made by tsmc and works fine). So, snap 8gen1 is hot garbage. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. It's like putting a heating processor with a smaller battery. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby atmos mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing thing is, the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22 (only s22 ultra had vapor chamber). Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazeit.shop tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around ₹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Cons -Screen has no dolby vision, its is limited to 16M colors instead of 1 Billion and is 1080p. Bluetooth codecs are limited to sbc, aac and ssc (samsungs seamless codec). So for HD audio you have to go with SSC, samsungs buds 2 Pro, since aptx won't work, although sonys Ldac can work. Inbuilt video player of samsung cannot play some audio formats like dolby truehd, or dts. Only AC3 or AAC are relevant.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.Edit 4. - saw some people complaining about battery. Initially battery life will be about 5hrs, cause phone uses adaptive setting, means it learns usage patterns initially for few days(you could turn that off in battery settings). Also, there was a software bug with the keyboard always on, and consuming extra battery (it's been fixed). You should easily see 7-8 hours of battery life after that.

Compact and sensible smartphone
","
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.What's good about the device?1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.What's not so good?1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.When it happens, it's quite annoying.However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

This is the best compact phone in market, even in 2024. Great performance, great build quality, great cameras, great software experience & a great display.Battery life is decent, I get around 6-7 hours of screen on time. But considering it is a compact phone, it is acceptable.This is still better than S24 because of Snapdragon 8 gen 2. If you can get 256gb variant below 55k, it's a great deal.Note - Try to get 256gb variant cause other files consume too much storage.

After using the phone for more than 10 months, the only downside I feel is lack of a 2k screen but the full HD screen is really bright and high quality. Camera, processor and form factor is amazing

A premium phone but...
","
Every review that you have seen about this phone is true to quite an extent.Great camera, good features, and premium quality and is the perfect size for me. I would prefer a 6"" phone but that's the best you can get. It's a little on the heavier side but it doesn't really matter if you are using headphones.The cons:1 - Battery drains really fast. The reviews I saw did not warn about it. This is my biggest grudge, having gone a bit over budget.2 - Samsung's boring UI. BTW I never imagined I would buy a Samsung product. But seeing the comparos with iPhone 14, I felt I should give it a go. One Plus, for instance, gives a swipe option to go back to the previous page. Samsung still depends on the back button at the bottom of the phone. After using One Plus, this seems prehistoric and inconvenient. It would request Samsung if they make this small change.3 - For some weird reason, it takes very long to start. It's a costly phone. I do not expect it to be so slow4 - Again, the reviews I watched said it only warms up a bit only if after heavy usage like gaming. This one heats up at times to the point of getting uncomfortable. However, it does get cooled down if you just close the apps.5 - 25W charging at this price is quite low but I understand. The heating issues of the previous models might have to do something with it.Hope my review will help you make an informed decision.

Ordered the S23 on 10th October, 2023 and received on 20th October, 2023. As a prime member I want to thank Amazon for their super fast delivery.Jokes apart, the phone is wonderful. At first I want to tell the cameras are one of a kind AWESOME. They take outstanding images as reviewed in most YouTube videos. Low light shots are amazing and you will really enjoy taking those MOON SHOTS. Portraits are on point with perfect cutout. Overall I am highly satisfied.Coming to the battery backup, in the first few days I was getting around 3-4 hrs of SOT so I changed the refresh rate to standard 60Hz to which I am actually used to, Performance to LIGHT MODE and using DARK MODE all the time. So after few days, now I am getting 5-6 hrs SOT. also to let you know I only do casual gaming for less than an hour or so.For calling I faced no issues. For media consumption I have nothing to say. It's Samsung and they make one of the best displays out there.If you are planning to buy this and use for long term, buy the 256GB variant as it comes with UFS 4.0 which is double the speed than the UFS 3.1 that comes with the 128GB variant. If possible use all CARD DISCOUNTS available then you can get at the best price possible.THANK YOU

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

Everything good with the phone, heating has improved considerably compared to the Exynos era, phone's perfect for one handed use, and yet.. Samsung has its own pitfalls. The pros can be found on YouTube, ill share the cons1. The battery wont last a day with normal or above usage, maybe the evening but that's it, i understand its a size factor issue, but the battery optimisation sucks compared to ios (same size though) (better half has an iPhone 14..easily lasts a day)2. Camera still lags if you use it for a longish time, heats up & gives up3. Photos are amazing, but somehow they're hell bent on making you look fairer.. irrespective of whether you like it or not.Everything else, is top notch & worth it

the Samsung Galaxy S23 5G seems to be a great smartphone with impressive features. The cream color gives it a sleek and stylish look. With 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, the phone offers ample space for all your apps, photos, and videos. The 5G capability ensures lightning-fast internet speeds, making it perfect for streaming and downloading content. The high-quality camera system allows you to capture stunning photos and videos with ease. Overall, if you're in the market for a new smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S23 5G could be a great choice, especially considering the deal of the day price.Camera has amazing features and depthSamsung should provide charging adapter because online we are facing issue to buy genius chargeI don’t know why companies are doing such cost cutting rubbishIt’s great phone but Samsung has given pain of charging adapterIt charge so slowly with 20 or 25W charger and even in product description or in manuals they haven’t mentioned which charger will support this phone

Best android compact phone.

The compact factor of this phone is the biggest plus point. The touch and software experience is good. The samsung phone dialler is bit less versatile after my experience with redmi note pro experience, but can get used to. I already have a google drive paid cloud subscription so i opted for the 128gb variant. If you dont have such subscription, then go for the 256gb variant as 128 will be insufficient  after a year or 2.Samsung knows the power of this phone so has kept it a bit overpriced, but its worth it if you are going to use it for about 5 years or so. Please note that there will be no cover or screen guard supplied with the phone and when you install a aftermarket screen guard, see to it that its biometric compatible screenguard else you will not be able to use the biometric functions.

Everything is Good except below average Camera
","
I wanted a compact phone with overall good performance and Camera. After months of Research I was thinking to go for Pixel 6a or 7a or Pixel 7 but none of the mobile in India did not had 256gb option I went for Samsung S23 256gb as I had got good exchange offer and discount. First few days I was worries about Battery but if we have Battery Protection option which will charge mobile till 85% it will not last a full day if we use much. So I started charging above 95% a d I am very much satisfied with Battery performance. But the biggest disappointment comes from the Camera Performance which is lacking Consistancy. Sometimes the photo looks so good with bright colours but many a times particularly when you are trying to capture a moving person the photos are very bad and many a times the photos looks stretched and the light glare issue as reported by many others is still seen. Sometimes the photos taken will look like painting with dark colors and it does not even look natural. Software wise Iam coming from Pixel 4a but still I don't miss it but when it comes to Camera the satisfaction which I had with Pixel 4a is lacking badly in my Samsung Galaxy S23. I hope Samsung will provide updates with major improvement in Camera as Software Updates will be provided for 4 years and I feel that too much focus was give on Ultra and the base S23 was missed to focus even though the Price of S23 is still high. If Camera is main focus do not go for S23. This is my first Flagship Device and I wanted to use my device atleast 4 to 5 years so Camera Update will be my major expectation from Samsung and Battery Performance should remain the same.

Purchased the S23 after 7-8 months of launch saw tonnes of comparisons and got all the latest updates.I wanted a solid phone which I can run for atleast 3-4 years without any issues.Bought this over the iphone 15 due to the iphones inferior display and camera & I wanted the 256 gb version only.My friends have the 15 so it was easy to compare.This being a 6.1 inch phone doesn't feel that compact at all since the bezels aren't that thickFor context I was using a Oneplus 7 (6.4 inch) earlier.I forgot how handy these compact phones felt.Battery life depends from user to user.The first day I got it I charged it up to 100% at around 11amPlayed COD , used Spotify- YouTube - Insta , checked the camera performance all day long & still was left with around 30% at around 12 at midnight.Just wish they included the 45 watt fast charging for the S23 as like the S2+Really satisfied with my purchase as of now.Will update if I find anything noteworthy.

simple and short review..Using  dual sim --- JIO 5G in SIM 1and airtel SIM 2( VOLTe LT whatever it is called )You will need to charge the phone atleast twice a day to keep the battery level up, if you are using as a primary phone.This is the basic thing that's really important.I'm using the Samsung 45 w charger i bought at a physical samsung store. cost me 4500 Rs. if i remember right.if you have a secondary phone then you can probably be out the entire day and not worry about the s23 draining battery

I stopped using Samsung for more than 10 years and was quite hesitant to move back to this after using OnePlus for over 10 yrs now. However I was looking for a phone with good camera and this one came in my shortlist from reading reviews. Got a good deal on Amazon sale with exchange offer. I must say the camera and photos are just superb. The processing of photos by Samsung is great and you get nice colors. The phone is very responsive and doesn't hang. The UI also is good and the only issue I have is on fingerprint/face sensor as it's not very responsive. Don't know if this is due to the screen guard which I have fixed or not. Anyway if you are looking for a good phone for its camera then you can go for it ...also the fast charging is slow compared to what you see in other phones. It takes more than an hour to charge but the charge stays whole day.

This phone is the best android phone in my personal experience. Samsung's one UI skin makes it awesome. I would like to talk about the best things I felt about it. Camera, Software, Display, Design, Handling, some of the Samsung's own apps like gallary and associated editing tools, notes, health, quick share, smart things, secure folder,  notification pop up styles, nox security etc are very handy and useful tools. Timely updates is also a plus point. Specially the S-series of Samsung is very decent and powerful line up.

It's design, It's weight all things is perfect only 1 big issue is battery. So if you don't have any issue with battery then it's a perfect phone.

Bought 256GB variant for ₹73,500. Got same day delivery.Packaging could have been better. There were no bubble wraps. But the contents were intact.Now coming to the phone, since most people will be concerned about battery life, I will start with that, there is no need to worry. It comfortably lasts for a full day, provided that you are mostly on Wi-Fi. I have added screenshots of battery stats. For the first 3 stats the phone was connected to Wi-Fi for about 80% of the time. For the last one phone was on mobile data for 90% of the time. The phone takes around 1hr 15 mins to charge when using a 20 watt power adapter.Other aspects of the phone are also superb, like camera, smoothness of the UI. I hope Samsung doesn’t mess that up with software updates.PS: I am using the Ringke Fusion-X  case with the phone.

Battery: on average use i got 14 to 15 hrs of Battery life and 6+ hrs of screen on time. Generally it would be sufficient for one day to use (morning to evening). [Okayish]Camera: its fantastic. Portrait mode at 3x is unbelievable i don't think even iphone can compete(Reference attached). Image processing is outstanding and you'll get tons of premium post editing features like object eraser etc. [No competition]Display: Its Samsung's Display so no comment needed. [Sexy dikhta h]In Hand feel: Bahut halka and grippy h. Premium feel aati h. Recently one of my friend bought iphone 14 pro we both found that very bulky and uncomfortable for long use. [best one hand friendly in market]Final verdict-: agar aapke mathe pe iphone k naam ka bhoot swar nhi h to S23 is a best deal for you. It has tons of premium practical features that no iphone can provide you. I accept people buy iphone for public appearance but if Samsung get that brand value then no iphone can compete S23.Edited: Superfast 5G support and very good HD call quality. No issues with mobile network found. Pop-up and Multi window (you can use as much apps as you can on one screen simultaneously) features are awesome. I am also adding SS of battery usages. Charging time from 0 to 100% is 1 hr 15 min.

Screen is perfect. Battery, after OneUI 6 update, is giving me 11 hours ""screen-on"" time (before, it was 5.5 hours). Performance is snappy, call quality is great too. Something I realised after owning it was, Samsung has packed in so many 1st party smart utilities (like reminders, note app, document reader, etc) in it that I feel I would surely miss if I'm ever to leave Samsung. Call recording without announcement is a rare good feature now. One another thing I should point out is, typing long and fast in the 6.1 inch screen is not real easy, though. Overall I'd give 5 star.

Being a flagship phone, it should  have better connectivity.. but it sucks..websites do not open, both wifi and mobile networks have some kind of bug. I am unable to use internet, i have to constantlyrefresh and restart my device for better network. I am getting  missed calls alerts via sms although  mobile network shows full strength..I think samsung should look into this. its very irritating. Never faced this issue in my 4.5 yrs old oneplus 6.

Delivery took 10 days, but i believe it is due to sale (multiple orders).Pros:1. Compact size.2. Flagship camera's.3. Top notch processor4. Awesome display.5. Pleasing dual speakers.6. Samsung dex, wallet are cherry on top.Cons:May be they could have atleast 4500 Mah battery. Average usage like camera, Calls and whatsapp like apps should give average of 1.5 days (or around 6-7 hour's) screen on time.I feel it is wort opponent to iphone 15. Which are similarly priced.Strongly preferred for some one looking in compact size with moderate use only. Heavy users need to carry a power bank.

Fantastic Phone - Best Compact Phone Period.
","
This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

Very good

If you are looking for small size and light weight it is best. Display is very good. Charger and remaining accessories have to buy separately which costs around 2k more. Finger print sensor is not that good. No heating.

Compact phone with an all day battery, great cameras and superb software support.
","
Most people are here to read about the battery life experience.I am a moderate user and the purpose is mostly for calls, taking photos, streaming etc. I don't play any games. I have optimized the device by removing some Samsung bloatware that I will never use. I run a light performance profile, as that suits my usage. With this setup/usage, I get around 1.5 days of battery life.If your usage is similar and you want a compact phone, go for it!

Loving it. Happy with the purchase. Happy to own a top of the line flagship mobile by Samsung. And it delivers value to satisfaction. Owning Samsung S8 tab & S6 Classic watch & their sync with the overall Samsung ecosystem is a joy to use.

Spotlight  in Samsung

It's  really  a compact  phone by Samsung,  the display,  sound, gestures overall looks is too brilliant. Superbly designed by Samsung.  If anyone is a compact  user he or she can opt for this no doubt. The overall  weight is quite impressive. But the battery  is in little way negative  bcz now a days if you are a heavy  user will find problem quite a little but if you are a normal user you will find it well balanced  smartphone.

This is my first time using Samsung flagship device and really impressed with this. Got it in Rs. 43500 by exchanging my Oneplus 8T and some bank offers. Performance is top notch. The phone feels very smooth. Camera is impressive. I love how it is comfortable to handle. Only thing I don't lime 8s slow charging speed. It takes more than 1hr to fully charge. Rest everything is good. Some more customization should be there like app icon size. Overall I am happy with the purchase. 😊

Better Than Iphone 15/15 Pro 🔥
","
I bought the S23 only for photography, and it just blew me away. if i had to say something about the camera, I would say it's a mini DSLR. I also attached some photo samples; the camera quality is simply amazing and better than the iphone 15/15 pro.

After so many years I have seen a samsung which doesn't heat and works very smoothly and efficiently. Battery backup is good and cameras are also in the top league. The 120 Hz display is something else, once you use it for sometime you can't go back to 60 Hz which I had in my Samsung Note 10.Got it @65K (256 GB variant) and I feel it is VFM product at this price.

Beautiful phone lavender
","
Wow is definitely an understatement. Lavender. Such a nice device. Buttery Smooth UI, handy product. Decent camera. Just the right size. I was using poco f1 which was 6.2"". This phone is 6.1"". For me battery is not very good. But I just got it yday and am using it pretty heavy...getting used to it. Maybe over few days I'll get more backup. Still battery is pretty good for  3900mah.Apps are all pretty snappy. Am just confused abt Google apps vs Samsung apps. But am figuring it out . Haptic are also good. Not as customizable as MIUI. But it's pretty good. Some Samsung apps are kinda bloatware. So many new unfamiliar apps...other than that, everything  seems to be fine. Shall update.

Well rounded decent phone from Samsung
","
Writing this review after 1 month of using this device. Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

This phone has everything you need. First of all, it sits comfortably in your hand with or without the case and feels sturdy enough. Camera, display, sound and software experience are fantastic. Battery is decent, but could be better when compared to 2023 mobile standards. But couldn't complain based on the phone size though, gets me thru the day on moderate usage. Mobile internet and wifi work flawlessly. I got it for 53k, so couldn't complain.

I would love the camera quality 9f this phone. I am Attaching few photos which I took in one of the marriage in night.Talking about the Batterry- Easily one day with very heavy uses.Speed- snapdragon 8th gen 2 with extra clock is so much smooth and no lag in last 1 week. I have installed heavy games and my official apps as well. Till now it's like charm no si gle lag I have observed. Earlier was using one plus 9 and now jumped on to this device from one plus to flagship samsung. I can proudly that it was a wise decision.Charging speed is also very good. Your phone will take approx 1.3 hour to charge full. Ons- only one cons is no Charger with the phone  but you will get good discounts on cards so you can use thT for Charger. Other then that I am very happy with over all performance.

Buttery creamy performance-best compact phone
","
I bought the cream version and it looks very premium. Was in dilemma whether to buy Oneplus 11 which was costing around 55k. But got this gadget at 56k with exchange bonus which was icing on the cake.Coming to phone, the battery life is decent . I Get only around 5 hrs SOT /17 hrs  in total till battery life and I have very high usage like excel, chrome, and social media apps. Dont play games , so dont know the performance. But its buttery smooth .Outdoor brightness is exceptional. It is joy to watch videos on this on display.Camera is also excellent with very good portraits and night time shots with 60fps recording .Only con is slow charging , should have given 45 w charging option, 25W is slow and also the battery dies from 5% to 1% within like 5 mins.

Camera too good. Display is dope af. Feels super nice to hold. Flagship experience all around. One small con is the camera arrangement, one below the other, hand touches the cam sometimes, will get used to it in a few days, plus and ultra won't have this issue because the size is bigger I guess. Battery is just decent but still way better than s22.Cam performance drops dramatically indoors or when light is low, even in the morning. Could use night mode to get better pictures. Relies a lot on post processing of the image. Sometimes images feels too HDRish without having hdr turned on. Pretty sure future updates could make the camera much better. In bright light both front and back cameras are amazing. 4k 60fps videos are too fiire, screenshots from video will look as good as standalone images. Ton of detail. Stabilization is excellent. Slo mo is fun too.

Everything is top notch,battery,performance, camera,feel,features and anything.  I was a first time samsung user at this price and it had made me completely satisfied within 20 days of use. Battery almost lasts more than 1 day near to 1 day 1.5 day with normal use, surfing without gaming.  One must go for it without doubt.

Compact iphone alternative
","
This is my first flagship Samsung device.  Prior to this I was using Samsung A52s. I also have a iphone 13. The size is almost exactly the same. If you examine closely, the body of the S23 feels a bit narrower. In my brief usage I am experiencing some heating but I think it will sort out after a few days.  Phone is definitely smooth even though I am restricting usage to lite mode. The haptic feedback is okay but not as remarkable as I was expecting after my usage of Nothing Phone 1 and iphone but its not bad either,I just had more expectation. I have received this phone after exchanging My A52s at ₹15,250/- and the exchange process of Amazon was much easier than what I have experienced with flipkart's exchange.Overall,I am quite satisfied with the purchase.
