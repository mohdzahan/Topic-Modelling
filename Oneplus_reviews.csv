Beast (best) phone at this price with well thought compromises
","
Been using OnePlus 11 for about a week now and at this price range there's no phone right now which can be considered as an overall package.Pros -Extraordinary battery life and even better 100W charging. You'll always appreciate how this makes your life easier when you know you can get your phone charged to 50% in 10 minutes.I don't think I need to review the SoC which is 8gen2. It's not about how super powerful it is but how good it works in terms of efficiency and heating. Though it is start of summer only, I haven't felt gte phone heating up even once. It's like these two problems which ruined last two years Android scene are non existent this time.Display is quite capable with Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos tech, the viewing experience is as immersive as it gets at this price or may be higher.Haptics are awesome, you don't see (feel) haptics as good as this except iphones or pixels.Color OS inspired Oxygen OS is quite good and if we ignore some bugs highlighted by MKBHD. I moved from OnePlus 6 which was maybe pinnacle of OnePlus and Oxygen OS to this and I feel like it's an upgrade.4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates. Their updates are not as frequent and useful as Google but this adds to phone's overall life. You can at least get it repaired and have parts replaced in this window. I couldn't get power button replaced on my old OP6 because it was out of support.Camera is decent. It is actually competing with Samsung and iPhones and beating them in low light shots. This is change as OnePlus cameras used to be B+ which is now A- with other flagships at A+ but they also don't come this cheap except pixel. One disappointment is front facing camera. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU'RE A SELFIE LOVER and don't like Vivo and Oppo approach of making your skin look smooth and brighter. Front video is also called at 1080p which is a shame. Should have been 4k30 at least.Cons - as said earlier, there are some annoying bugs/features in UI which can be easily fixed through a small update.Display is not brighter indoor as iphones and Samsung ultras but you won't feel if you haven't seen those.One very apparent disadvantage vis a vis S23 is lack of Wireless charging and IP rating. These are compromises which I think ok to not have if we are getting quad HD display at this price. Although I would have preferred reverse wireless charging so I could charge my earbuds on the go.And last, the most beautiful thing about his phone is it comes with charger and screen guard and a phone case in the box. Appreciate this when trillion dollar companies like Google and Apple don't provide this despite charging more than 1 lakh.I hope you find this helpful. I was criticizing OnePlus and Qualcomm heavily for past two years on all platforms but this is the year they have turned it around.

Good phone and definite flag ship killer
","
I bought this after lots of research. Green line issue was holding me back, but OnePlus is now providing life time screen warranty(*conditions ), but a positive move to build trust of customers.Pros:Primary camera is great.2x zoomGood portrait photosSnapdragon 8 gen 2 handles tasks smoothly16gb ram, 256gb (usb 4.1) , 4 years android update and 5 years security update makes the configuration  future proofBattery easily last a day , 20% battery left with a screen on time of min 6hrsCharging speed is awesome, in 20 mins you hit 100%.Many useful hidden and cool features : draw V shape pattern on lock screen to turn on torch, draw O shape pattern on lock screen to launch camera, raise hand for selfie photoCons:Minor bugs in android auto. It gets disconnected (some times after 20mts) and I need to reconnect.Gets heated during charging( manageable as it is kind of expected when u charge with 100W charger).Selfie camera is just 16mp, it's a main draw backWill keep the review updated after more usage.

As a OnePlus family member I just upgraded from my OnePlus 7 to OnePlus 11.Pros:1) Screen quality: Looks and colours are awesome.2)Fast charging3)Long lasting battery: After heavy usage I will get 6.5-7 hrs of screen on time.4) camera: Th portrait shots looks awesome. Front camera is average.5) OnePlus UI: Easy to handle, since got used to it from past 4years.6) performance: As of now no lags observed during BGMI or day to day tasks.Cons:1) At this price range if they would have given IP68 water resistant it would have been great.2) Slightly heats up after continuous usage.3) very few times UI doesn't respond very quickly like how it does it in normal times.4) poor call quality, I'm facing regular call disconnects. Not sure it's mobile or network problem.Finally after exchanging my OnePlus 7 after using for 4 years upgraded to this. Hoping for another long-lasting performance from OnePlus.

its not a bad phone, its not perfect either.
","
so before i start, I've been using Samsung phones for the past 8 or 9 years. I already like the one UI and the perks that come with it. Now i booked S23 and then realized the fact that it is a bad deal for a phone that was already worth a lot of money. Now I' not saying this phone is also worth your hard earned  money. this has its flaws and a lot of people here have already pointed out many of it . Yes the camera processing sucks(sometimes), yes the video quality is meh(compared to other flagships), yes it sucks not to have wireless charging and many flaws follow the suit.The unit i received is working absolutely fine and has no heating issues or jittering or any thing else(physically and software wise my unit is fine till now). The phone takes just  25 mins to get to 90-100% from 20-25% charge. The screen is an E4 panel but its is damn good. The battery life (until and unless u push it really hard) is absolute top tier. I'm a person who attends office meetings through phone most of the times. this thing has an solid battery life that will last u a day and then some. The in-hand feel is good but you really have to be careful as it has a glass back that has ZERO grip. The sound is really good (quality is ok, bass is meh, loudness is 11/10) and it actually feels like stereo speakers.Now if u ask me if this phone is worth 60000, it is not. PERIOD. And u shouldn't buy 8GB version as it is a even worse deal. You can buy iPhone 13,14 or S23 if u have good exchange offer.(but then u'll have to buy a charger, back cover... all extra which i don't appreciate).I would recommend this if u have money to spend, else U can buy 11R which is actually a steal for that price. I gave 5 stars becoz the phone thts in my hands is perfectly working and is of great use to me. it hasn't shown any glitches or software issues either (no hardware issues too). i just hope this thing lasts for a couple of years and it doesn't turn to a sucker with updates coming.

Pretty good
","
Operating system -Coming to OxygenOS from MIUI, it is a pretty good switch. I have never used OxygenOS or ColorOS so I am not the best person to tell you whether this thing has been downgraded from previous versions or not but in my personal experience, the UI experience has been super clean, no bloatwares, a lot of good tutorials spread throughout the UI to help me understand the OS which was also good. Haptic feedback is also very good, I had not realised how much a good haptic feedback can improve the overall experience until now. There were couple bugs which were super minor. But overall it's a pretty solid and minimalistic software experience!There are the multitasking features which allow you to use multiple apps at once and it is super convenient. On landscape mode the notification panel changes to better fit the orientation. There are just small quality of life things in this software which I really love and find useful.One thing I despise about the software is the individual notifications, it is super annoying, you cannot expand the notification by swiping, you need to click the notification to expand it, then click it again to open the application. I hope OnePlus fixes this or at least adds a toggle to change the behaviour.Cameras -I am not a big camera enthusiast, but I can pretty much tell that the cameras on these probably cannot keep up with Google, Samsung or Apple's offerings in this price range. It's still pretty decent and in 2-3 shots you get the product you want and shutter speed is also decent. Overall it's good enough for a casual user.Screen -It's good. I don't have much else to say in this department.Battery Life -Lasts me about a full day on moderate usage on pretty high brightness and on 1440p. But what is exceptionally better for me is the charging speed. I just plug it in and in about 20 minutes I got a full battery, it doesn't heat a lot either which tells me battery health will probably be good for longer.Performance -It's really good on casual usage. I am not too sure about gaming though, I am not a heavy mobile gamer, I prefer my laptop over mobile for gaming, just going off the online reviews, this is probably not the best mobile for gaming.Design -It's good enough for casual users. Camera bump was slightly annoying at first but I got used to it. I am not a big fan of glass backs so I am glad this came with a case which is also really grippy and good enough for most people. Alert slider was something I didn't know I needed, it's a really good feature.Sound -It's good. Again, not much I can say here.Overall if you are a casual user who wants a well rounded phone for day to day use, this is a pretty solid option for an android phone.

WHAT A SHOCKER OF A LET DOWN!
","
In the family, we had several OnePlus devices, from the earlier ones to the 7 Pro and the 7T.When the company started losing its bearings and direction and moved off from its ""flagship killer"" tagline, we knew that something was going wrong.  Also, it lost its market share in India, indicating something was amiss.We moved on to phones like the Huawei (still an excellent phone and waiting for the next pro release) and the Apple Series, from the 10, 13, 14 Pro Max, and the Samsung s22 Ultra.  These are highly impressive phones.When the OnePlus was re-launched, with all the Hasselblad stuff and having attended the live launch online, I thought the company was back on track.  Many reviewers spoke/wrote about the speed processor, the refresh rate, and all the hype around the ""back on track"" phone - I decided to go for it.  At 62,000/- for the 16 GB and 256, I was excited about the prospect of a high-end phone.The first letdown was the horrific camera picture quality. All the phones mentioned earlier far exceed the low-level picture quality of this one. All pictures were lifeless, duds, even in outdoor conditions, and indoors was even worst.  I wonder what Hasselblad's role in all this horrible photo quality is.Many functions were hit-and-miss.  Every time I made a Reel on Instagram with about 25 photos, the App would crash.  It never happened in any other phones I had. Something with hardware or IG, I wouldn't know, but it never happened before.The apps opened fast.  The smoothness was fluidic.  But the colour options, Vivid, Natural, and Pro, were all weird.  Photos downloaded from Cloud, clicked on other phones, looked so different.  But something was lacking; character. I didn't seem to have any feeling of attachment to the product in hand.The slimness was excellent compared to my S22Ultra, and the features were okay.  It looked premium and felt so.  The best battery life. The best charging speed. So many things were good, but...I went back to all the professional reviews in Magazines and online. Many said, ""will it sell"" and ""did it miss a trick"" and the height of everyone's remarks was Peter Lau (the founder of One Plus, but now with his company Nothing), who said, ""It lacks identity"".  That hit the nail right on the head.  An Apple has its identity.  Samsung has its signature.  My friend who owns the Nothing 1 is highly impressed with the natural skin tones of the pictures clicked (no added spice).THE ONEPLUS 11 HAS NO IDENTITY AT ALL.  IT IS A ""NOTHING HERE, NO THING THERE"" phone.Will it be able to correct its plethora of flaws with future updates?  Or the wrong idea of a camera that went completely wrong, with poor quality results?On a closer look at the picture quality, I saw that it was more of the Oppo type of result.  The skins look plasticy.  Men's skins look makeup-ed.  These were the traits of these early Oppo phones, and people (especially girls) liked the smoothest looks, like baby dolls.Many things are not right with this phone, in spite and despite the latest processor, high Ram and everything else supposedly good.Since there was no return option, and the exchange date was at hand, I thought, I would keep it and give it away to someone not so discerning and would overlook the camera's poor quality.It's gone from me, and no regrets.Will I go the OnePlus route again?  I don't think I want an Oppo Phone.  The good old OnePlus is dead and gone.______________I hope discerning readers will understand what I have said, albeit there may be many positive reviews about this phone.  It's nothing personal towards, OnePlus, but my experience with the OnePlus 11 5G has been a severe letdown.

I'm writing this review after 7 months of usage.Good things:1. Superb 2k 120hz display with additional HD features. Great for watching content.2. Strong audio both with and without earphones.3. Great primary and portrait lenses in the back camera setup - good in low light too.4. Next level charging experience.5. Good battery with 5-8hrs of SOT.6. Sleek design with rounded corners.7. Having 16GB RAM is ridiculous. Never gets slow.8. Regular OS and security updates so far.9. Very very few glitches - a truly flagship experience.Things that could be better:1. Front camera - good photos but bad HDR in videos and video calls.2. Display is not as bright compared to other 2023 phones.3. Shutter lag.4. Camera consistency could be improved. The post-processing of images gets skipped like 20% of the time.5. Shooting videos could be improved. Noise reduction is almost non existent. Night mode gives usable results in only AI mode in 30fps.

So far so good
","
It's second day and it looks very satisfying. I had OnePlus 10T that I exchanged for OnePlus 11 at around 30K. You can do it through OnePlus site also with slightly better deal but mobile would come after a week by Blu Dart slow system.All good so far. I was apprehensive as I had OnePlus 10T only over a year but then took a call for OnePlus 11 as I found my 7T was better than 10T, which itself is good but not the top notch.So far so good. I was not sure that I would get delivery on same day as the item didn't move in the tracking and called customer care. The Amazon customer care is just amazing. Not only I got the item but delivery person delivered it at 10.35 night.I hv been an Amazon loyalist for their sheer professionalism that is not even 25% in Indian e commerce or online shopping.Adding after 2 months that OnePlus 11 is working exceptionally well. Smooth interface, fast speed, decent camera and satisfying battery life that easily last a day. Very nice curvy feel that makes navigation super cool. Though it's 204 g but feel not too heavy in hand and is better than my previous 10T. Brightness is too good but contrast and sharpness could have been better with increased brightness. I liked it more than 10T for sure.

Love the Phone and it's quirky Features| Hate the Android Stock apps
","
Everything is great, don't waste money going for 12, it's more than enough. Remember no Storage Expansion slot so use your space wisely. Overall it's a great phone.Hate the stock android mix.• E.g No speed dialing, can't mark all sms (have to manual select each text to delete)• Button placement for volume is low• You may need an additional Glass protection for the Camera bump• included phone Case is pathetic and low effort

Powerpacked device and great camera quality
","
I bought oneplus11 256GB variant black colour.Really great performance. I have used it for 6 months never found any lag while clicking pictures, videos, watching movie and gaming.Doing all this it can easily last for 1 day. And even the charging speed is really great, you can keep it for 15mins and it can work for all day with limited usage.Camera quality is really is excellent, it process the pictures in such a way that it looks like a DSLR professional shot.The back of black variant is really soft to touch. The picture is having a cover on it.No delay in fingerprint scanning, never found any issue.If you are confused b/w OnePlus 12 and 11, I would suggest you go for 11 bcz it's almost similar. But if you are someone who wants to use latest tech then go for 12 and if you are getting heavy discount on 12 and price point is just showing 2-3k difference then go for 12.But I would recommend you to go for 256gb variant, I feel that 128gb will be consumed in few months if you are not using cloud storage.I bought OnePlus 11 with OnePlus buds 2 offer so got the deal at great price.

Great Phone but Please fix BUGS Oneplus
","
The phone is really great. Let's know the pros and cons in place and Hope Oneplus team Fixes the Bugs in the software ASAP.PROS:- Great value for Money.- Great Camera and video recording.- Great Battery life.- Amazing Dolby atmos surround sound and don't need earpods while watching movies.- The curve screen feels best and has a good screen quality.- What a amazing Fast 100 W charger we have. Just go & take quick shower and it will charge 0-100% very fast.- Can play games like PUBG & Battleground Smoothly.CONS:- Notification drawer is such a pain. Gestures won't work on Notification panel to go back or swipe.- The phone automatically starts up if I had plugged in the charger during Power Off. It shouldn't automatically turn on.- Fingerprint senser is again a BIG PAIN. I have to manually unlock with Pattern or Face as Fingerprint senser unable to read even after multiple attempts. I have very clear prints on my fingers still performance is very bad. My Redmi phone reads fingerprints correctly and very fast. Oneplus pls fix this.- App Drawer sometime stucks. Swipe up should open all apps while Swipe Down should minimize app drawer but it doesn't works.- When Chrome is opened and I use Slider to Slient/Vibrate/Ringer then it automatically opens 'Find on Page' on chrome browser. Don't know how slider is also opening this.- I wasn't able to download Apps from Playstore in 5G so still confused it is Oneplus issue or JIO 5G issue.- The Torch is warm light, and It should turn on Both the flashes instead. Please give user the option.- When Close All apps it doesn't closes any application. When I again check about how many apps are opened in background so no apps are closed. I have to manually close each app.- I feel Ringtone of OnePlus is not loud enough in full volume. Kindly recheck.- The Phone feels Buggy and not smooth in Software experience. Would be great if Oneplus look into this feedback and resolve bugs and improvise the Phone experience.Thanks and Happy to Switch to Oneplus 11 5G. Thanks Amazon for faster & safe delivery.

A below average flagship

I ordered my One Plus 11 in February 2023 with a lot of excitement as this was my 1st phone purchase after 3.5 years with my iPhone 11. One of the key factors for moving back to Android was the improved UI experience.However, OP 11 is one of the best examples of how the spec sheet doesn't always translate into a great phone in reality. Don't get me wrong OP11 has a lot of pros but also some frustrating cons that ruins the day to day experience. Let me explain below.UI: The Oxygen OS 13 is blazing fast and clutter free but also has loads of bugs, some of these got better with the latest software updates but also some got worse. To start with, the Always On Display doesn't always display the latest notification but repeatedly shows an old message which is absolutely useless. OP 11 didn't come with Android Auto at first but it was added in a software update later but somehow I'm not able to us the same in my car for the last 1 month.Fingerprint Sensor: Optical fingerprint sensor in OP 11 is quick but doesn't work even if your hand is a little sweaty or wet. I miss the rare mounted fingerprint sensor on my OP 5T.Cameras: Camera package sounds impressive looking at the spec sheet but the experience becomes underwhelming due to the poor software processing. Shutter speed is slow compared to my iPhone 11, white balance is inconsistent and human subjects turnout to be unnaturally bright. However, OP 11 takes some of the best nature & portrait shots, you get vivid colors, great HDR output and near perfect edge detection in both the main and 2x cam. Selfie cam takes bland but acceptable pics in daylight.Performance: This is where the spec sheet means business, be it app opening time, multi tasking or graphic intensive games, you're always covered. If performance is your what you're after, you'll never be disappointed.Battery: Battery charging is blazing fast. I get 20% to 100% charging by the time I finish my breakfast and I go through 24 hours before I need to plug it back so I don't care about the lack of wireless charging.I hope they improve the UI and photo processing performance soon as it really has a great hardware package.

But I fell like mobile is discharging  faster than any other phonePerformance: performance wise nothing is there to complain, good performance no lag no hanging at all.Memory: go for 256 gb,IT Will not support HDMI out using type c cable, even 30k samsung s21fe having it.Mobile fallen so many time and nothing happen so far, built quality is good.Not feeling worth for 56K

Heating issue
","
I've been using this phone since 8 months, if you use any app for more than 30 mins phone starts heating. If you increase the brightness outside it starts heating in 10 mins. If I watch a video for more than 30 mins it starts heating. And also camera quality is so poor in low light condition, it whitens the people at low light, it's so annoying, there is no option to turn it off. By the way, if you use camera for 15 mins it starts heating. Might be a good phone during winter with all that warmth to handle.

It's too fast but discharging is also fast.Speakers are amazing.Ui is very good.

Runner up with iphone 14 but boss is always a boss
","
After a month's use I can say that I took wrong decision by returning iphone 14 plus to buy it in pre launch event.Boss is always a Boss. It is like student in the apple's class. It's like a silver in the begger's bag.It has screen sensitivity issue at both curves  i.e you have to press multiple times to write ""p "" & ""q"" and all character in that column. It heats sometime , in my case today was 2 nd times when kept under pillow. It's UI stacked once  within one month of use.Hassalblad camera is not that for which hype was made. In this segment camera hardware is for 48MP only and by making use of software it upscales the quality to 50MP that's why it takes time to process image at 50MP unlike at 48MP. I appreciate it's battery backup almost equivalent to iphone 14 plus which last almost 2 days with light to normal use. Charging speed is really high it charges full in almost 20 minutes (no deviation from specifications ). It should have wireless charging due to being at top in their hierarchy . OnePlus depict non-availability of wireless charging as it runs in the race to prouded themself to be at 2nd position. Do not get impressed by the YouTube review they do justice with the sponserd company and consumer equally. Hassalblad  is used only for USP, it just upscales the cost to divide and rule against iphone13 segment follower but it failed to impress those customers.

I am writing this review after using it for a week.What i find about the phone isPros-Undoubtedly It has great display.-Haptics are just superb-Charging speed is good it take 25 min to get 100% from 0-Smoothness and Ram management but ui bugs are there.-Back Camera is good colour improvement is still needed.Cons-Full of bugs screen always get stuck and blackout anytime and its too annoying to restart phone again and again.-Battery is getting drained faster-Even it has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 but it's fps gaming performance is worst than 15K phone.- 100% cpu usage and 10% gpu usage WTF is this?-It hardly able to maintain 60Fps in low settings-Camera is just descent no natural colour is there.-Front camera is stucked to 16MP not even able to record videos in 1080 60fps and colour are over saturated with warmer tone.-No wireless charging-No ip rating- Sometimes jittering in scrolling might be fixed with software update-No dolby vision support on speakers yet.These were few pros and cons about the phone it is good  in terms of hardware but software is worst and Oneplus has to fix all these stupid bugs and have to optimize there software integration so that hardware could be effectively used. Just waiting for software update to get all these things fixed.Don't buy this phone for gaming.  it's ui experience is worst. I would say go for 11R that's worth pricing.I will update my review if issues get fixed in updates.

Better value for money compared to Xiaomi, Samsung or Google flagships

I am not a gamer, nor a photo enthusiast, neither I use my phone for audio/video streaming. I am a pure tech enthusiast who loves to experience the latest tech.I wanted to upgrade from my 24 months old Oneplus 8T and I had two options- Oneplus 10 Pro or Oneplus 11. While Oneplus 10 Pro offered better charging capabilities(wireless) as well as IP68, yet I went with the later for the sheer reason of latest processor- which is the heart of any phone. I usually change my phone every 18-24 months because the technology becomes obsolete in this period.Oneplus 11 that I got works fast, but ridiculously, I don't notice much difference between 8T that I was using just a few days ago. May be over the time I will discover the difference. The screen is bit large and the phone is heavier. The screen is amazing since there is Dolby Vision in it with a staggering 525 ppi resolution density. Cameras are also different this time with Hasselblad color calibration, however, the camera theme color(orange) is weird and can't be changed. Expected our Indian, NavIC positioning system that was released two years back but Oneplus 11 doesn't have NavIC support.  The biggest difference I notice is the charging speed. Using my older 65W charger, and it juices up from 20 to 100% in 20-25 minutes, much faster than the Oneplus 8T that has lesser capacity of battery. Bundled a 100W charger with Oneplus 11, I don't know if I would be able to charge it efficiently in my car or any such place(without phone charger).Overall, a nice phone, priced decently. Offering everything a flagship should offer. Compared with Samsung S23(+), Pixel 7(pro) and Xiaomi 13 pro which offer similar specifications, I will prefer Oneplus 11- despite having the ColorOSed OxygenOS as the operating system, simply because of the price factor.

Having invested on a flagship for the first time, i must say i am delighted. This is my first OnePlus device and i am writing this review after a month of usage:Pros:1.Battery life (1.5 days on normal usage- no gaming)2.Charging time (25 mins -10% to 100%)3. Excellent screen works great in sunlight with adaptive brightness4. Crazy fast processor and the 16 GB RAM is delighting...games do load really fast.5. Camera quality is a great highlight (works beautifully even in low light & captures excellent color reproduction in normal lightings.6. UI is light and feels quiet convenient. ( I was nervous about it ...since i was a long time MI user and switching from MiUI does make me nervous)Though not many cons but there were some essential features missed at this pricing...Cons:1. No IR blaster though the OnePlus 11r has it. That's a big disappointment.2. No 3.5mm jack :( ..this is a big disappointment...they could've easy fit one since the phone form factor is not slim.3. Though this is not a very big issue.....the phone does feel heavy due to large screen....even for someone like me who is 6ft+ and large hands. This gets worse with a casing on.  Doesn't easy fit in jeans pocket.44. No wireless charging for a flagship! :(Overall.. definitely a great deal to have. I think with this configuration and sturdy build...it should last my target life of next 3.5- 4 years. :)Well done OnePlus!

The fast charging capability is something I genuinely appreciate about this phone, great SOT too. Good bright colors on the screen. But camera is something that you won't feel appreciative of. Portrait is great and 2X and 5X options are good too. Otherwise, the camera is pretty generic and I expected better. And a flagship phone shouldn't lag the way it does at times. S23, Pixel 7/8, iPhone 14 are a better bet at this price of camera is your only concern. Rest, if you need fast charging capability, then make peace with this device. It'll grow on you.

Loving this product! Value for money
","
Purchased this product after lot of hesitation since I was using Samsung Galaxy S22+ for last 1 year. God! I am in love with this product. It's awesome all rounder phone & somewhat now my S22+ is sidelined.Comparison directly with S22+ :1. Display: OP11 is more eye friendly & cherry on top is Dolby vision support so you are gonna enjoy multimedia consumption more on OP 11 than S22+2. Camera: S22+ will get a score of 10 but OP11 will bag 9 ( as front supports only 1080p).3 Battery: OP 11 is clear winner you can rely on it as a daily driver with 100W charging support you don't have to worry for recharge. Recharges within 20 minutes when battery falls at 20%.4. Performance: top notch is with OP 11 & OP 11 is clear winner5. UI: Samsung is clear winner in this department. I would rate 10 while OP 11 will bag 9 for UI.6. Value for money: OP 117. 5G & 4G network reception: OP 11 is way better than S22+ Call quality is clear on both in outdoor condition.8. Speaker: OP 11 has more loud, clear & immersive speaker system.9. IP rating: Samsung is clear winner10. Wireless charging: Samsung has an edge but you will not feel it's loss since it is well supplemented by 100 W charger in the box.11. Haptic feedback: OP 11 has clear advantageConclusion: This is my first product of OnePlus after using Samsung S20FE 5G & S22+ & I am satisfied with this product.If you are planning to buy new phone & you have budget of 50-60K then you can consider it as a reliable phone & I would suggest opt for 16GB 256GB RAM variant since it comes with UFS 4.0 which will secure it's performance for 4 years atleast.Direct competitor of OP 11 are S22+ S23/S23+ iPhone 13/14 & Pixel 7As a user I find pixel & iPhone have compromises in lacking telephoto lens & charging speed. I consider these features very useful especially when you are outdoor & clicking portrait of DSLR level.

Advise to buy from one plus store only not online
","
This phone started heating and hanging from day one. I reported Immediately to Amazon and they started explaining their return policy and refused to return or replace,  Finally I reported to service centre and they solved my problem , from last 3-4 days it's working fine. Although all features of one plus 11  are very good. One plus service provider told me that online replacement is 15 days only while one plus provide 30 days. Amazon takes order and provide order from electronic shop located in villages so it's not trust worthy to order costly items

Was happy with it and never faced any issues but wanted to switch to 5G so bought one plus 11  I got same day delivery by 11 pm. One plus 11 5G is very smooth with modified features, super fast charging, no heating issues, camera quality and performance is very good, apps are opening faster, keypad is smooth, overall a very good mobile. Worth it, I just Love it 🤩. If you are looking for a better 5G mobile then one plus is great👍

","
Updated review after an year of use:The good🟢:1. Performance is great. Didn't experience and lags while multitasking2. Amazing display and sound quality (microphone as well as speakers)The 🟡1. (Often) After installation of a security update, Google calendar stops showing meetings. This happened thrice, so I switched to MS outlook calendar.2. Smart charging doesn't really work. It says phone will stop charging at 80% till you start using it. It never stops, keeps going till 100%. Only saw it working once, during late night or in the wee hours of the day.3. Camera: It does something very weird to photos clicked in room or indoor lighting (normal photo mode). Kind of over enhances photos amd ruins the light balance. Creates kind of a weird pop, or aura around the body. Gives a yellowish tone to white colours. Potrait mode, 4k60 video mode are all find though. Very good actually.

Fix the bugs One Plus!

Overall a great phone but somethings that will frustrate a user to hate the phone are the touch/response bugs to open, close notification, open app drawer, or try to delete by left or right swipe it still cannot but prompts you to use the delete button.Keeping in mind the screen is tall there are no response to touch or gestures with one hand use.The whole reason I bought a new phone was because my old phone had all those bugs that got to my nerves.Just to find myself stuck here with the new phone with the same issue. This has killed the hype, thrill and excitement I had for One plus 11.I updated all the last patches as well hoping that would fix the issue but it does not.There is no pinch zoom in or out, our pinch adjust widgets it's super annoying because no matter what you try it just won't budge ooofffffOne plus kindly help

I am long time samsung user switching from s20plus to onplus11 here are my observations.1. Need to adjust lot of setting to get the basic layout like samsung ( I don't like too many gesture).2. I work in IT so I need to have my workprofile VPN enabled all the time to access company mail. The silent notification ( VPN ACTIVATED) always shows in notification is quiet annoying and this notification can't be disabled.3. Call quality is good but I feel someone near me can hear if we are using ear speakers low volume itself .4. Android auto not working in cable ( Sony xav5000). Not sure what's the reasons . Latest update fixed this..5. I still prefer samsung akg type c headphone but every when I plug in a wired type c headphones I need to enable otg connection it's an annoying thing.6. At times Amazon app got freeze once I restart its working.My request is keep the basics clean without too much changes required.

Amazing battery. Super fast charging. It easily lasts for minimum 30 to 36 hours. With light usage, it can lats even more.Processor must be great that phone quick. There is no lag. I bought it immediately after its release, so still it is performing well. Has good options for customisation.Camera is amazing with some pre defined filters. So pictures come out well. But at times, photos comes out saturated, I mean intensity of Color will be high.Overall good buy.

I was using OnePlus6 for last 5 years, While phone was fine in all aspects even after all the years, battery drain was the major pain. I had to charge it 3 times a day and each time charging was taking one and half hour even with OnePlus charger and red cable. I am quite satisfied with OnePlus11 in that aspect. It has come with a 100W Charger and from 20% to 100% takes hardly 20-25 minutes. Also, presently the charge holds for more than 24 hours, how long it continues to give that performance is yet to be seen.

Big upgrade from OnePlus 7t

This is a review after 1 month of usage!Prons:1. I loved the display quality which is top notch 🤩  which is good for movie lovers2.Battery life is the main advantage which last long 7 hours of screen on time.3.Coming to camera quality I loved it which clicks best photos and videos.4. Charging from 0 to 100 it take 25 mins which is insanely fast.5. Haptic feedback are beast no phone can match the strength of this OP116. Speakers are not top notch but decent performanceCons:1. At starting I noticed freezing 1-2 times later I didn't faced it again2. MEMC chip missing where it's previous devices had it.3. At higher use phone get heat, heating management could be improved.4. Some bugs with 3rd party application, like in WhatsApp some photos are not visible to put story and it take long time to upload.I hope in coming days OnePlus gives better software update without ruining it.

I was using my OP 5T till this June. Even though it's SD835  it was a beast . But battery was dying. I found phone was dying too. Amazon gave an offer of 10k extra for replacement for this phone. So I took the offer. Yah replaced my 5T with OP 11. To be Frank it is one of the best upgrade. I am not a OP fan boy. I just needed a clean OS and beast chip. And I got it .Yes ..the phone is a beast in everything. But let me tell you this , the camera isn't good as we think , especially the front cam . Front cam is so boring. Other than that ...I find everything good. Literally everything. Thanks Amazon for this .

Got good exchange value and bought the phone.Battery backup is nice, nice display, great camera.****Review after 10 months***I am sharing both pros and cons here:.1. Only issue is the phone's front camera is very bad compared to price point. The camera unable to balance the light in the background.as a result whitish picture captured. Tested woth OP 11R , it has same issue. Sometimes even phone says to clean the front camera when even it is clear.2. Till now no issues with performance & battry backup. For daily use my SCREEN ON TIME is avarage 5 hrs, and the battery gives full day backup.3. Super duper 1st charging, now I do not have to worry about last minute charging. Sometimes I put my phone in charge 30 min before going out for office and it charges from 17% to 89/93% easily.4. No green line appeared till now. Software & security update comes monthly.5.just keep the phone Dry(yes lil bit of rainfall & splashing not harms phone). But still try to keep phone dry.6. Use only screen protector (flim protection), do not use TEMPARED GLASS bcz the glu goes inside the phone and stucks volume/power bottom or other issues. Had to visit service centre 2 months of purchase. Coz of the TEMPARED GLASS (uv light, glu)..Aside these lil bit of issues , phone is great.Recommended++++

OnePlus has Definitely Settled now
","
Despite having top of the line specs, OnePlus has failed to deliver a flagship device worthy of its price. The device is good, however the performance is not up to my expectations.Issues I am facing:1. Abnormally excessive battery drain (SOT Max of 2.5 hours) despite all optimizations and updates. My 3 year old Samsung device lasts longer than 1 week old OnePlus 11. Highly disappointing battery.2. Oxygen OS is not the one we had earlier and quite a lot has changed, however this doesn't change your experience, just that you don't feel like owning a OnePlus flagship (only the fans from OnePlus 1 etc. will relate to this).3. After sales service is as good as none in my case from OnePlus, as they closed my case of battery drain without even inspecting it thereby absolving themselves from giving any replacement or refund.4. Camera is only decent but definitely not worth 50k.5. Fingerprint sensor doesn't work 2/10 times but works great when it works. Face unlock also works fine.

Superfast!

Performance: pretty fast, we did not see any lag in a week's use. face unlock and touch unlock are as fast as an iphone's. you can open many applications but phone will not break a sweat. new processor has really done a good job, with practical 16gb of ram.Security: it provides lots of security features for locking phone: face unlock, pattern, password, number lock and fingerprint.Screen: It has a very bright screen which works well indoors. little dark under the sun, but I feel it is ok. curved screen gives it a good look.Camera: Picture quality from back camera is decent, only drawback is it overexposes photos some times, so white balance needs to be adjusted before taking photos. same goes for front camera. telephoto and macro modes do a decent job. front facing camera takes decent pictures, but photos are patchy and have excess sharpness in low light mode. video calls have decent quality.Connectivity: 4G and 4G connectivity is great and there is no apparent lag in network. 5G gave around 100Mbps speed on ookla.Battery: battery backup is decent and phone lasts for a day with moderate use. new processor is fast and phone does not heat up when charging or during overuse as our previous oneplus 5. 100W charger is good and charges full phone in under 30 min in practical scenario, without heating phone.Build: phone is little at bulky side, feeling of which will disappear when you are used to it. Phone is pretty sturdy and looks good when held in one hand.overall a good purchase.

FLAGSHIP KILLERRRR...??
","
Coming from OnePlus 8T, it is big upgrade in all aspects.Directly coming to the the point it has all awesome improvements, flagship killer performance.Display is awesome.Battery performance outstanding.Heptics and speaker quality is best.Camera is improved, but needs some updates to make it flagship killer.Specifically the portrait lense is not as sharp as 32MP sounds. Ultrawide is good and clicks sharp pics. Main 50MP senson is good, captures enough light, sometimes warm. There is color shift between all three sensors pics. Low light performance of the main and ultrawide is good, not best. But low light performance of portrait lense could have been made better.Overall the camera hardware is definitely flagship killer, but to make it up to the mark, compete with other camera phones need some future updates.Only one bug I have found when using hotstat or YouTube, after killing app still there is media playing in the background🥹🥺Will updates this review after receiving new updates.

This phone is trying to get the old reputation of OnePlus back but still a lot to do.Pros:Great Camera, both front and back camera takes nice photos. However not happy with macro photos.Battery life is good enough to last for a full day. I'm getting SoT around 5.5-6 hrs for my usage where I use office email and chat regularly and consume media. Charging is super fast.5G reception is great. I got upto 600 Mbps in my City over Airtel 5GI'm not a fan of hepatic feedback but the hepatic feedback is great in this phone.Cons:I have serious concern with the software. This is noting like old Oxygen OS and got quite a few issues.The 120 Hz refresh rate is really not visible while scrolling through Gallery app, You tube, Amazon app etc. You tube page gets stuck while scrolling sometime.The app drawer has issues. Some time it just won't appear in first scroll up.I think RMA management is not so great and I see lag while reipening some app from RAM.I also find that wifi switching to the strongest one does not happen automatically.In my camera usage for bit longer(10-15 min), the phone was bit hot.Overall Im happy to get the top of the line Hardware which is likely to last for 2-3 yrs and I hope OnePlus fixes the software issues as soon as possible.

Got at 50k with OnePlus tws.Main camera is very good. Telephoto and ultrawide is decent.Front camera could have been better.Only 1080p 30fps is very bad in front camera video. They should upgraded their camera sensor. they just use old imx 471.Battery life is very good at fhd+ resolution and decent at qhd resolution.Not so noticeable difference between the two resolution. So I recommend to use at fhd+ resolution.Refresh rate in some apps drop to 60fps like ookla and YouTube app. This should be fixed via software update.Charging speed is blazing fast. In 5min 50% and 25min 100% from 0%. In practical test.Feels premium in hand.Speaker is loud and has depth in sound.

OnePlus has come back
","
Upgraded my phone, the last phone I had bought was Asus Zenfone 5z, back in 2018, and it was a banger.Fast forward 2023, I decided to buy a phone as my phone was quite dated. Had several options in mind, including, Asus zenfone 9, iPhone 14, samsung s23, pixel 7pro, iqoo and then some more..Finally went with one plus, though I had to compromise on wireless charging, no headphone jack.I must say it's value for money, it might not be as feature packed as samsung s23 ultra or iPhone 14, but it is a great phone none the less.The things I liked the most about OnePlus 11(bought 256 GB,16 GB variant)--Camera is great-Snapdragon gen 2 is quick at multitasking-Display is beyond words for me-The updates that I am getting(till Android 17+1 year security update extra)-refresh rate really makes difference-absolutely no lag while gaming-great battery backup-very fast charging (though I recommend to switch to normal charging for longer battery life)There is only one issue I faced once when the file manager did not open for some reason, but it was a one time glitch I think..All in all I would say, I can live without wireless charging and headphone jack(will be using Asus Zenfone 5z for wired listening), saved a lot of money over competition while comprising very little.Anyone having any doubt can follow my advice , you are making the right decision..

Best phone in 60k right now
","
The display is just awesome with 2k panel and curved display.Battery will last for one day and 0-100% in 20 mins.Camera is best but don't compare with S23 ultra or iPhone 14 pro max. Compare with the same budget smartphone then you can feel it is best compare to others. The video in 8k and 4k is also good.The built quality is with matt finish and metal body and the haptic feedback is really good. The Alert slider is back and it is handy feature.OS : I know the Oxygen OS was great and smooth. But now it is Oxygen OS layer on colour OS, but in this OS also there is no ad or extra bootware app. The OS is also smooth.I know the green and pink line issue on OnePlus going on. So when I talk to the Customer care they clearly mentioned that just before updating the phone take a video of the update and after update the issue comes then they will replace the display for free.

I upgraded from iphone xs and I am pretty happy with it. The feature it provide are only present in iPhone pro models which are above 1.2 lakhs currently. The best thing is battery charging speed around 25 min for full charge and it can stay for 1 day normally. The screen resolution and adaptive refresh rate is also a plus. I am not a camera fan but it captures great night shots. With 4 years OS update and 5 years security update and wifi 7 update are the best things the company is offering. In Love with this mobile . Haptics are again next level and it provides support of Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos . Overall a pretty good phone 🔥

Excellent device for the price.I'm writing this stubby review and will use it as a running log to report the good and bad about the device.Until now, the phone feels great! Definitely feels like the old OnePlus of yore, and the good part, thankfully.The handfeel is very good, it masks the weight and size of the device, designed quite well.It's a joy to type on (fabulous haptics!).The screen is really good.The battery life seems to be holding up well (using on qHD + 120hz).It did heat up during the initial setup but calmed right down after a while. Not heatup up during normal usage. Did get warmish during a Super-Sus session (not blazing hot, just warmish).Will report specifics after using it for a few days. Received the device today (16/02/2023).

OnePlus comeback of sorts.
","
First thing first, let's just accept OG Oxygen is dead. What we have now is ColorOS minus the bloatware which is mostly a clean experience.• Superfast, S8 Gen2 is way superior to S8 Gen1• Excellent camera setup, good colour and video well stabilized• Charging is fast with 100 watts charger in the box but not the fastest by any means.  You have to enable rapid charging to get the max charging speed, useful when you're in a hurry• multi tasking king. Had 30 apps running in the background - zero lag.• Good sound output overall• It's not a light phone but the ergonomics is excellent. Good inhand feel.• Absolute best haptics, beats Samsung too• Battery life is okay. 6-7 hours screen on time.OnePlus has made best efforts to come back after 2 disastrous years. Still not OG OnePlus but on the right track..

Defective piece received.

Update: Received a new piece as replacement from Oneplus service center, but had to wait for 3 days to get it. Being a flagship, i would have expected a replacement within 24 hours.Anyways, the customer care and service center personnel was courteous and helpful.The performance is fantastic, and initial impressions look very good.======================================================================Earlier update:Received a defective piece from amazon. I'm waiting since past 5 days for replacement.There is no upside buying it from amazon, better to buy from local store instead whrere we can check the phone throughly.My new phone's speakers were bad and there was dust underneath the preinstalled screen protector.Looks like the Quality Checks is going down these days with oneplus products.===================================

This is a totally value for money device at 61k. I bought the 256gb version and it's perfect for everything. Not big on photography. But from what shots I took, this one is one of the best I had used.After 4 months:I can definitely say that I have made the right decision by purchasing op11.Great lag free performance.Wonderful battery backup of 8 to 11 hours with heavy usage of which 80% of the time is on content consumption like YouTube, video streaming and movie viewing.Cood enough camera for my use.Perfect display and viewing quality.Charges the phone from 0 to 100 in 30 to 40 minutes max.I only miss the wireless charging capacity compared to my old OP9pro.In 55k, this is the best phone you can buy.

Previously I was using OnePlus 5 so got it exchanged with this one. For me it's a huge difference. I was planning to switch to iPhone but didn't want to leave Android.As a OnePlus Lover this phone is the best ❤️ and OnePlus is back again with a bang. Flawless finish and functioning with a beautiful design. ❤️Pros:Camera - Awesome with HasselbladProcessor - Most PowerfulDisplay - Smooth and CurvedAudio - Dolby Atmos 👍Con-For me the only con is it is a slightly heavy phone. Use a back cover for back protection and camera.Verdict - Definitely for those who wants to stick to Android and wants a Fast processor, beautiful design and awesome camera setup.

Extreamly Fragile phone: Wastage of Money
","
I am using this phone for more than one year now. Backside of this phone is also made by glass. As a result, if this phone drops on the ground accidentally, the glass made backcover would be broken for sure. I went to the service center to change it. They billed INR 5500/- and changed it. But within 3months after this replacement, it got broken again. It does not fulfill the basic requirement, how will you be happy with other features?

I took this phone to multi task as I have heavy Office 365 usage and also streaming online movies/live cricket. in last couple of days while Office 365 was active and I was streaming IPL match phone got heated up. With such great processor and high memory I was not expecting it to heat. Heating issues are still there and this should be reviewed by the company. Otherwise seller as done great job in delivery and packaging.

I bought 16gb version. The phone is smooth, display is bright enough in outdoors, battery life is good - would easily last a day, charges from 20-95% (typical scenario) in under 30 mins.Camera is good so far (haven't tested it thoroughly)Negatives:1. The scrolling speed is very slow. My old OnePlus 7 has a faster scrolling speed. This slow scrolling speed is across apps - even swiping up & down in the app drawer is slow! This is super annoying!!2. Notification needs to be reworked a bit. It's not easy to use3. Minimum brightness is still very bright

Upgrade from 7pro ->> 11,not much diff feel
","
So when I purchased 7 pro 4 years agao then it was gream amazing feeling but while switching from 7 pro to 11 doesn't feel much difference as both phone sizes are same and just the camera diff and performance wise 11 may be better but I never faced performance issue in 7 ro as i NVR use parallel apps or very rarely.Just had to change because the old phone screen got broken.I feel if we are able to use these phones for next 5-6 years while full formatting 2 times in between then it's good investment.Fun part: front popup camera not available like 7 pro which used to look cool and never disappointed but my kid kept pressing it to make it non working and this one doesn't have that one so it's good.Gestures of old os were good but not this new ones which we get in oxygen 12,13 because u try to drag someone like crop from left and right it goes back

Had one plus7 pro. Still working fine and looks as new. Upgraded to 11.Disabled Google dialer and installed o dialler which is original.Works fine. Google has hijacked contact and message app. Phone is good. Photos are slightly better than one plus 7. When u Press power button  one would expect to restart or shutoff however the twerp google assistant comes on. Have to reset the power botton option in additional settings to get it to do it's intended purpose.Latest update -Jan 24- My old One plus 7 pro had a motherboard/main board failure and  data was irretrievable, it was 4.5 years old . This has made me think about the quality of One plus phones in general and the 11 5G 256 which I have . A company becomes successful at first and then they implement cost cutting on production and take customer for a ride.  I would recommend Backing up data on a monthly basis , if you have already bought this. if u have not bought, try out another. Hence reducing the rating to 3

Apart from a couple of bugs that I noticed in my daily usage, this seems like an outstanding phone. Nothing that cannot go away with an OTA update or two. Charging speed is insane and battery life won't let you down. Camera is decent enough for clicking pictures. I am not into vlogging so I don't really bother about the front camera capabilities of not being able to record a 4K video. Sound is loud and crisp. UI is highly customisable and I keep it the way I like. Feels like a premium phone and is surely a noticeable device.

First of all the phone is a beast in every aspect. Screen, camera, battery everythings is top notch.No software issues, charge once and forget for 2 days unless you are a heavy user.Curved screen looks beautiful.Rest of the positive you can findingr YouTube reviews.But iam stating the issues which are not discussed,The following issues which I have discussed with global OnePlus 12 users and they are facing the same issue as well so it's not specific to this model.1. When you try to switch from certain apps to browsers (e.g - Instagram to chrome) you will face a momentary lag for a second or two.2. The phone battery temperature is little on the higher side not that you can feel in you hand but it's still showing 2 deg high compared to other phones in the same ambient temperature.Rest assured it's a fabulous device in this price range.

Very good device according to price
","
It's a very good device according to price. Previously I used Samsung s24 ultra. But I prefer this one now for some practical reason.1. Samsung offers anti reflective display. But when you use with glass protector, there is no advantage. Samsung s24 ultra is really brighter but OP12 is decent for the price. Further it has better PWDM score.2. S24ultra has very fast ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, but when you use it with glass protector, it will be a hit or miss, laggy. On contrary, OP12 optical fingerprint sensor is really fast. Moreover, face unlock is much better working in OP12.3. In battery segment, both are good but OP12 is a clear winner in terms of fast recharge and SOT. OP12 is also offering "" stop charging @80%"" option.4. S24ultra is better performer in camera obviously. Stability of footage taking is far better than OP12 but, OP12 is not bad at all....it takes really good photographs.5. OP12 is running behind s24ultra in terms of AI. But the scenerio will get reversed soon. S24ultra integrates with Google Gemini Nano version for AI features whereas, OnePlus is integrating Gemini Ultra for Upcoming AI features. Just wait for a few months.Lastly, according to In hand comfort, OP12 is better.So, according to price, OP12 is a better choice. I bought it @48500/- upon exchange with Samsun M31. I am happy.

BEST WAY TO SPEND 65K. !
","
After a long wait of almost 3 yrs, i finally got my hands on a proper flagship phone.I won't go into the specsheet because it's awesome and we all know that !DISPLAY - it's simply beautiful, 2k resolution is so good. all type of content looks great even basic WhatsApp looks great on it.BATTERY - 5400MAH is monsterous along with 100W charging is soooo under rated. I'm a power user and still at the end of the day it is always over 30%.CAMERA - proper flagship setup. Now comparing it with apple or samsung which cost 40k more than this is not right. But still I am mighty impressed. I have put up sample pics in order of wide ,1x, 2x,3,6x,10x,20x,30x. U can see it for yourself. !UI - just one word ie. Excellent. Oxygen OS is very effective and efficient!PERFORMANCE/GAMING - anything and everything on  Play Store u throw at it, it just fly's through it. Black desert, codm, asphalt9 etc. !SPEAKERS - loud and crisp that's it. !HAPTICS - best in the business.!ONLY NEGATIVE I FIND IS THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER IS OPTICAL AND NOT ULTRASONIC. OUT OF 10 IT MISSES 2 TIMES IN MY USAGE.OVERALLL A GREAT BUY OVER PIXEL OR S24 SERIES AND APPLE PHONES. TRUST ME U WILL NOT REGRET A BIT. !! CHEERS...

I became OnePlus fan since using OnePlus 5t, I have used every single t version launches and this would be the first time using OnePlus 12 without the t version, let me tell you it's a great phone with great features. Previously had 10t and I don't have any regrets in going to OnePlus 12,Pros:  battery backup is awesome, have loaded 300+ apps and easily I get 24+ hrs of backup on heavy usage.Working on multi task app is crisp, no lag at all.Phone doesn't get heat after using long hours, a bit warmth can be felt while on rapid charging, 0 to 100% charges in <30min with 100w chargerMusic is crisp and clear with good volume.IR blaster works like a charm.Cons:  Camera clarity is ok ok in low light, but with bright light or daylight photos are awesome.Volume buttons are a bit concern to operate as am used to buttons on the left, in this you will get to the right with power button.Can't operate with one hand, feels bulkier and unsafe as the camera portion is a bit bigger at the back.

The phone started to hang and touchscreen was problematic right from he beginning.After that when we contacted customer service they kept deluding us till the time for replacement got over. I talked to over 7 agents over a span of 2 days, and not only did they not resolve the problem, they also gave false hope of refunding the amount when I gave a poor service feedback. They promised they would contact after 3 days and now there is radio silence... do yourself a favour and don't buy gadgets from here at least

-Heats up quite a lot outside.-Video shifts colors between warm and cool tone continuously during video call. Very annoying.-Had to remove bloatware. Not expected at this price range.-Not a compact phone. But I guess compact phones are dead.-Overall camera quality is good.-Performance is also top notch for a non gamer. Easily can last 5 years.-Battery doesn't last as much as advertised.-Fast charge is really fast.-Wifi connection and call quality is good.-Stop saying oxygen os. This is clearly ColorOS.-But all cons aside, they gave charger in the box. Looking at you Apple, Samsung and Nothing.-Build is also good. But curve screens have to go.Good option if you don't want to waste money on S24 Ultra. 90% features in half price.

The all rounder phone without breaking the bank
","
It's the perfect all rounder phone without cost above 1 lacs. The battery life is outstanding, last 2 day full. I don't use the phone much for social media and stuff. As a general Mobile user the battery is outstanding. The OS is the clean version of Colour OS. And the camera quality is on par with the costly flagship. I moved from my S22, compared to that the camera quality is usually a less of AI boosted processing and more true to life images. If you are confused between this and the S23 or Mi 13 I would say this is a better phone when compared to those.

Ditched my S22 Ultra For This phone
","
I was a samsung user for past 15 years, Used All models in S series since 2014. But this device was able to chnage my mind this time, Awesome Camera, Massive battery life, A very tough competitor of s24 Ultra. Sometimes I miss my S pen, but thats ok. Why shall I pay 1.3 lakh just to use a Spen. I am completely satisfied with this phone and not going back to Samsung anymore.Pros : Massive Battery.  * 100 Watt Charger included  * Nice Case comes with phone  * Preapplied Screenguard.  * Camera is 1000% better than S22 Ultra, can give a tough compitition to s24 ultra as well.  * Nice liquid feel display, again better than samsung this time.Cons:  NONE AT THIS MOMENT 😍😍😍😍😍

I was using iPhone 13 before and I switched to OnePlus 12Compared to iPhone battery backup, fast charging, and display quality everything is top-notch in this phone.Battery backup is too good and full charges within 40 minsDisplay quality is nice, processor 10/10Camera: I have seen many YouTube videos and most of the reviewers say the camera is not up to the mark but in my opinion, it's more than enough, the images come very well.It has 120x zoom, the master mode after the update takes a win, and a portrait mode is also fine.

This my first one plus earlier I used Vivo x70 pro, in comparison of both I felt nothing change except the more crispy display. Camera of Vivo x70 pro was better.

Only concern is that sometimes screen does not turn off automatically when not in use ! Cameras are good, zooming is interesting. Battery life is fantastic.

The shape of the phone is weird with huge camera lens and uncomfortable to hold. OxygenOs is not what it used to be and just a buggy copy of oppo's colorOS. There are lot of ghost and mistouches because of the ridiculous design and the curved edges. AVOID IT, if you need a reliable phone. Get an iPhone for some extra amount or there are lot of better cheaper alternatives which are better than it. YouTube reviews are all paid.

The inclusion of the alert slider adds convenience, and the speaker delivers impressive sound quality.The main camera produces high-quality images, capturing moments with clarity and detail. However, the selfie camera falls short of expectations, yielding mediocre results. Charging speeds are commendable, ensuring minimal downtime.Unfortunately, a major flaw undermines the overall experience—the microphone. Call quality suffers when using the loudspeaker, with recipients reporting difficulty in hearing the user's voice clearly. Similarly, recordings lack clarity, detracting from the device's functionality.In conclusion, while the OnePlus 12r boasts several commendable features, including a stellar display and reliable battery life, the presence of a subpar microphone significantly hampers its usability. Potential buyers should weigh these factors carefully before making a purchase decision.

Good phone and Nice Camera
","
Previously I was using a Oneplus 9R for last 3 years and hence satisfied with the brand One Plus. Another phone redmi note 5 was lying with me idle so thought of exchanging it for a brand new oneplus 12R which was delivered within 2 days.The delivery was fraught with very bad delivery experience due to a foolish delivery guy due to which I had to complain in the customer service and hope that suitable action has been taken against him.Coming to the phone which I been using almost 20 days now I will say that it is a premium featured phone with great display and a fantastic camera 50 megapixels.I have taken the 16GB Ram variant phone and presently highly satisfied with its performance and 100 watt high speed VOOC charge.Only one issue with the phone is the heating up while using it for syncing of data for prolonged time.I would say that you can go for oneplus 12R without much thought if you are interested in a 40000 Plus category premium smartphone.Thank you friends.

A flagship performer without the flagship price.
","
Easily one of the best purchases that I have made and well worth its price.Pros:- SD 8 Gen 2 is fast and very power efficient. The performance is indistinguishable in day to day usage when compared to SD 8 Gen 3 on a OnePlus 12 with UFS 4.0. Even though the 12R has a UFS 3.1 storage, you are unlikely to notice any difference whatsoever without running benchmarks or checking the specifications. In real life day to day usage, I have not found any difference and I am a power user who uses a lot of applications and use the phone over 8 Hours a day.- The vapour chamber handles the cooling very well which keeps the device at excellent temperature even when playing games for an extended duration. It almost never goes over 38c.- The display has the same features as the OnePlus 12 (the resolution is relatively lower but it's not noticeable to the naked eye without magnification) and this is one of the best displays that you will come across. The HDR performance is also some of the best I have seen and it is a completely different experience. This can also be seen in the HDR shots taken with cameras. I'd suggest going to a OnePlus experience center and searching for 12K HDR videos on YouTube to get a better idea. Note that the 4,500 nits mentioned is only the HDR brightness at a small white portion of the display under sunlight. This is NOT the max brightness of the full display. But it is bright enough to use under direct sunlight.- Battery life is very impressive with over 8 hours of SOT and the 100W included charger fully charges it in about 35 mins.- Also love that the display can be used even when your hands are wet unlike most other smartphones- The bezels are extremely slim and the chin is smaller than the one on the OnePlus 12. I do wish it was equal all around though.Rather than cons, I'll just mention what it lacks.- Wireless charging- Telephoto cameraThat's pretty much it. If you are looking for a smooth and reliable device with solid performance, battery life, fast charging, decent cameras and display experience, I would easily recommend this. Sure the cameras may not be as good as an iPhone 15 (81k) or a Pixel 8 (83k) but they also cost around 80% more than the OnePlus 12R.

Except the Camera, a flagship in all regards
","
Let me address the big fat elephant in the room.The camera is bad. Not mediocre, not average, just bad.Rest of the phone is pretty amazing, the smoothness of the UI, although I don't like the theming and the styles they have gone for the settings app. The experience as a whole has been positive. The apps stay opened in the background.I observed that Instagram and WhatsApp are by default RAM locked. This makes me wonder, if OnePlus just hard-coded the apps to keep in memory and called it RAM vita.The storage speed is honestly not an issue for me, when I connect my phone to the Mac and transfer the data, it's fast, not as fast as my S24U, but still plenty fast that you wouldn't complain.This is my daily workhorse with loads of office apps installed and running in the background always along with meets in outdoor. The battery has been the highest selling factor for me, I use the PD 70w charger and it charges the phone from 10-100 in about 45 mins, Even though the included charger is faster, this PD support helps me carry only one charger.Display gets very bright outdoors and while watching HDR content. No complaints there. Haptics are great, Audio quality and volume is awesome, I'd have liked to see more color options, like a white variant or the almond one of 7Pro. But it's what it is.Probably I might get another OnePlus in future if they come up with non obstructive screen like on 7Pro and with thin bezels and curved screen. Till then this has to do the deed.

Overall a good, sturdy and fast phone. Screen quality ok. Back camera very good. Front camera pathetic. See the sample picture of the same place I have taken vs back camera. If you click lot of selfies, don't buy. Some apps like gmail, hangs. Battery performance in first 3 months very good, no heating. Very fast charging with company charger.

A Complete Beast Phone
","
Was an Apple user for 3 years and finally exchanged my iPhone 12 for this and I'm happy with my decision.In Every department such as Display, Design, Performance, Battery,  it's like an ANDROID FLAGSHIP LEVEL (I'm a non-Camera guy so I would say it's camera's are bit okaish, it would be excellent if telephoto was there instead of macro).But one thing I noticed is that as an APPLE user, software on this phone is really nice but it could have been done better on some areas for better overall Flagship Premium experience.Just a hope guys but If the OnePlus team really brings back the OG OxygenOS to it's future models (or atleast differentiate it's OS from the ColourOS-ish) then ohh boyy.... this phone or the future models will smoke the Indian Smartphone market for a long long time.

Overall it's a bomb!!Features that I loved* There is no lag whatsoever till date. (As an architect I have some 3D viewers and pdf files to be reviewed daily)* Charging is extremely fast as promised.* Display quality is amazing. (can show presentations/renders on phone itself to clients)* Camera quality is good. Not the greatest out there but one of the best ones.* There are few hidden features to this phone sprcifically which don't come for even I-phones.* Another point to camera is that the CRI is much better with oneplus than with I phone. Pics taken by I phone always have a warmer output than what it really is.Problems that need to be addressed* Heating is not as bad as other phones but still needs to be improved.* Would be great if magnetic charging is included.* Front camera even though it is 16mp it doesn't record 4k videos.* Display glass is prone to smaller scratches very soon. Need to buy a screen guard immediately or along with the phone.

If your use is only for multitasking and media consumption and camera then definitely go for it. But in terms of gaming the performance is very bad, although it has Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor but most of the time game is laggy, it seems like mobile is not giving the full performance of the processor. And the major problem for gaming is it's curved display.

Quality , screen fluidity, built standards ...it just Marvel's.I had used Pixel 7 , Nothing 2 , and iPhone 13 pro ( still using two of these ) , and never been a big fan of One plus gang .. last time I used a one plus phone was 4-5 years back. I felt their consistency in terms of quality has improved over the years but in terms of newer features, I found them to be a but behind... Then I decided to get One plus 12 R few days back, ordered one and less than 24 hours later they delivered it. I must say in the world of Samsung and iPhone and bunch of other non flagship Android devices , One plus stands it's ground pretty solid and no wonder why.It quite a device , I mean with Oxygen OS and cameras.. there is not much you can complaint about . But the price and the 100W charger makes it even sweeter deal.If you are looking for a Snapdragon 8 V2 , you cannot go wrong here.

Value For Money

The OnePlus 12R brings a lot to the table, blending top-notch performance, an eye-catching design, and a stellar camera system. With its OxygenOS, navigating through the device feels smooth and intuitive, enhancing the overall user experience. While it excels in many areas, it falls a bit short on battery life, which could be a concern for heavy users. Additionally, the lack of UFs 3.1 storage might be a downside for those who need extra speed for their files and apps. Nonetheless, it remains a compelling option for anyone seeking a premium smartphone with a blend of style and substance.

Overpriced. Nothing great
","
Just overpriced stuff. Battery drains fast. Camera nothing wow.. Don't know but for some reason the fingerprint sensor is not that fast or accurate.. I am a Redmi user, and accustomed to fast access...I think don't waste your money here...5G Speed is not that good. Getting more speed on my Redmi 5G Phone.. Attached some camera samples.. for you to decide.. Remember the price you pay for it is a lot... I bought it for around Rs. 41k..

Replaced my 4yr old 7T with this one. I was debating 12 vs 12R, 8GB vs 16GB RAM.Opted for 12R with 16GB. Don't know if I need that much RAM, but took it just for future proofing purpose.I don't do gaming but otherwise it is used as a mobile computer for work and personal stuff.No complaints.

Camera need improvement otherwise good purchase performance wise
","
Camera is flickering and not as per expectation need more quality pics with 3x and 5x zoom as well and camera not avle to balance shadow and colour.Performance is good battery good smooth touch and feel.Step count app need improvement. Some applications not working with dual mode and multi app.One good feature is we can take out cutout from pic but we don't have ability to choose whom to select in the cutout it's automatically selected so ai is not fully working ,if I want one person cutout from the picture it's not possible.Xdr mode is there but how to store image with pro xdr it's just for check not to store after applying proxdr.

A Flagship Killer - A Good phone from Oneplus After 8 Series
","
I aa switching to Oneplus after using Pixel Series and Very impressed with phone.Following are Great Things About this phone1. Display - Display is super bright, super smooth and it is main highlight of phone.2. Battrey and Charging - huge 5500mah battrey is great, full use with samart watch connected I get almost full day battrey.And if battery is low Supervooc comes to rescue.. Charges phone in just 20 mins (0 to 100)3. OXYGEN OS IS GREAT with many great features.4. Other 1 thing I really appriciate is Irblaster it is a must have feature in flagship.TALKING about negativesCamera can be improvedAnd false commitment from Oneplus about ufs storage version in 16-256 variant was also not acceptable.

Mobile is very good but heating during charging.

Perfect mobile 16gb, 256gb & 5500 mah battery first time from One plus but at very high cost.🙆‍♂️😹Mobile is heating and which shows battery manufacturering defect may arise any time. Battery is the heart of mobile.Otherwise best mobile at high cost in the market.👍🙆‍♂️😹🙋🏻‍♂️

Review after 2 months
","
This phone is nothing special for anyone who looks to have everything but, before you conclude.Pros:It's battery is a beast. Trust me, with heavy use you cross more than a day easily. And with 100W, you can charge it in 30 mins.Camera - usual shots are excellent with main sensor, nothing exceptional in low light - it processes well in artificial lightMany may feel little heavy but for me weight is not seem to be heavy because of the curved front and back, very easy to hold.Audio - stereo speakers work charming. For earphone experience, I use Kratos Thump pro Type-C earphone. works well.Hearing/Gaming: you may feel a little warmth to slight heat while charging which is very common. But I haven't done any gaming, so no comments on that.Fingerprint sensor - finally the placement of FP sensor is just right! Placed a little upper compared to 11R, Neo 9 pro, Nothing Phone 2 and many other relevant phones at this price. Probably the only phone for 40k who did well with FP placement!Cons:OxygenOS is long gone, it is purely ColorOS. Having basic and adequate features similar to RealmeUI and ColorOS with some fine times.App clone: not supporting to many apps as of now. Only available for a very limited apps.Memory: they said apps can be loaded for days in memory and it won't kick you out. But my experience, it is not exceptional. Works just like others.Some social apps feel laggy at times. Not sure if it is app issue or OS issue.FINAL VERDICT: if you want a good upper mid range phone with a good battery life please go for it. It is a quite good value for money phone!

This phone lives upto the expectation. That's what I can say after using it for more than a month. Has great camera for it's price and AI features associated with image editor. Great multimedia experience with amazing screen and Dolby stereo speakers. Good for heavy gaming, giving good battery backup and all. Overall phone is of flagship level.

My first experience with 1plus ...This 12R build quality is premium and top notch.butter smooth experience with oxygen Os..they mention display 5000nits brightness .but its publisity stunt ..display brightness is not up to the mark.and battery is 5500mah . But its  like only 5000mah .and full charging very quickly below 30mins. Battery comes approximate 12hrs. if u heavy usage approximate 9hrs.camera quality was ok ok but need some inprovements. No Water and dust resistant ..perfect weight balance..If u have a 40K segment then go for it .. 12R never disappoints you .

Oneplus 12R is the actual flagship killer. This is for those who don't need any of the latest gimmicks. If you're looking for a stellar display, a great battery with 100w fast charging and good performance then OP12R is the right choice as of now.I got 16GB+256GB for 36k by amazon pay cc offers + exchanging my old s20+ that had green lines. Thank you Amazon for giving me great exchange value.
